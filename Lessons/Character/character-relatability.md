# Character Relatability 

## DESCRIPTION 

### Introduction

Characters are like good jokes: they generally require a degree of relatability for the audience to accept and continue to laugh at the ensuring strangeness. Relatability keeps your character from being just a punchline.

### Relatability in Humor

Relatability is necessary for an audience to understand a joke. The joke is grounded in some facet of reality that the audience can identify with. Knock Knock. Why did the chicken cross the road? A man walks into a bar. Generally the relatability of a joke lies in the setup. Of course it does, that is how we draw the audience in. Providing a grounded reference point allows the audience into a world they're familiar with, so they feel comfortable and are ready for the next thing. Let's use one of the above relatable setups, and let's dive into it in a purely grounded sense.

A man walks into a bar and he orders a beer. The bartender pours his drink and he downs it immediately. He pays and then leaves.

Not funny, is it? That is because it is totally grounded. These are just facts. Most everyone can relate to a transaction like that. We enter the world and we can easily accept the reality. The scenario is simply par for the course, we expect this sort of transaction and as such we can predict it. We don't need to hear about it. Frankly, it wastes our time to hear about it because it's not interesting. Nothing is different and distinct from the norm. 

Interesting stories that we share with our friends are grounded in our reality and then they veer from the reality because of something unusual that happened.

"So I went to the bar down the street for a beer. Not halfway through the beer, I see an Optimistic Guy walk up to this girl at the counter. I know that she's taken, because I saw a really big guy bring her in, all macho and with his arm around her, and Macho Man kissed her before he left for the can. The Optimistic Guy starts hitting on her."

There's the boring build up. Well, it's a little more interesting than the initial scenario, because it's clearly from a perspective, there are specifics, and there's a tension that's building (what's going to happen when the Macho Man comes back?). But overall, it's just there to set the scene so we can get to the good part. It's necessary to lay the groundwork so we can hear about the interesting finish.

"... I like to think that I'm a pretty upstanding guy. The kind of guy that would tell someone about the Macho Man that's in the john, the kind of guy that would let someone know about the big lumbering hulk that's going to return and punch that someone's lights out, the kind of guy that would warn him before he slipped his hand on her tush, the kind of guy that would go clear up the misunderstanding while the big juggernaut of a musclebound genetic anomaly slipped in behind the unsuspecting Don Juan, the kind of guy that would try in vain to pull the steroid-infused living Bicep off the tiny pulp of a button-up shirt dude. I like to think that I'm that kind of guy, but who can say 'no' to free entertainment?"

This story isn't particularly funny in-and-of-itself, but it's clearly set up to be funny for the storyteller's friends. The narration of the series of events while he's talking about how he likes to think that he would be heroic is a clear _Game_ in which he's continually not doing what he "likes to think he would do" and just continuing to watch the ensuing beatdown. The specifics showcase the storyteller's wit, as he's coming up with more and more different ways of describing the behemoth of a man, and he brings the reality and the "punchline" - or release of tension - home with the line, "I like to think that I'm that kind of guy, but who can say 'no' to free entertainment?"

Now imagine if there was no build up to the story/joke and he just said the punchline. We have no reference point, no world in which we can feel comfortable before we are given a reason to laugh. Orange you glad I didn't say banana? To get to the other side. He was unconscious for 30 minutes.

Now, there's a clear exception in the realm of humor in which a grounded story can become funny because of the clear expectations of the audience. 

Why did the chicken cross the road? To get to the other side.

If there was no precedent established, this is just a grounded question and a fact. The reason this is considered a joke is because of the expectation of the punchline in the question, and the lack thereof in the reveal. It's a clear case of anti-humor, where we play upon an expectation and then cut that expectation to shreds. The setup is then the question as well as the expectation, and the punchline is the absurdity of a grounded finisher.

One of my favorite moments in improv was the first time I dished out one of these anti-humor lines. This was in the game called Pick Up Lines:

Suggestion Gym

"Hey, I spotted you from across the room. I'm going to spot you up close because it's a lot safer that way."

Rather than playing off a setup into a pun or double entendre off dating/relationships/sex, I started with the setup from dating (approaching someone in a bar) and then finished it with something that's commonly done in a gym. Rather than moving from clean to pick up, I moved from pick up to clean (unintended).

### Lost in Translation?

Now, how does this translate to characters in improv? Well, I'm glad I asked! I would like to begin with a caveat and say that if you're in a situation that won't give you much time to dive into a character, you might not be able to create relatability. For instance, say you're in a Fast-Paced Short Form Set and you're playing Accents. You can pull off a great Russian accent, but there's more to it than the voice, so you opt to run with the stereotypes of Vodka, Cold, and Putin-like. I personally don't enjoy this, but if those are your circumstances, then you won't have much time to make it relatable.

The best characters I've seen have always had elements that people can identify with. If it were a child, the child had the same curious, ignorant, smart-mouthed way of talking and responding that a non-jaded child would have. If it were a creepy stalker, the stalker might find ways to conceal the fact that he's a stalker with more innocent terms (I'm just a photographer who specializes in candids), like how we would use nicer words to describe certain people (he's very opinionated rather than saying that he's an jerk).

The key is finding the human within the character. A person who's creepy has something underneath that. Don't treat your creepy character as being just creepy. She's a human being, too. She has a backstory. She has a reason as to why she's like this. What's her family like? What's her work like? How does she act when she's in her element? Humans are rarely one-dimensional (if ever), so your characters shouldn't be one-dimensional either.

Why would you bother making characters with depth if you can just play one facet and continue making it funny? If you're in a La Ronde, you need to be able to show a different side of a character. Of course, you have help there in the form of your scene partners' initiations (and presumably you'll always have help from your scene partners in every scenario), but it's also up to you to reveal those elements of your character. The jerk at work might be a very loving father who's dealing with some heavy issues. The creepy stalker might have lost her true love and has had issues with being overaffectionate because she wants to cherish every moment she has with the people she "loves". We are artists and geniuses; we don't have to make our villains into Disney/Cartoon/RomCom villains who are just the worst people imaginable, who do evil for the sake of being evil.

## EXERCISES 

### Interrogation/Interview 

One player is chosen to sit in the Hot Seat as a specific character. That character is asked questions about every facet of their life.

What's your name?

Where do you live? 

What is life like there?

What was your childhood like?

What's your family like? 

What are your hobbies?

Where do you work?

What is your passion?

Everyone has the opportunity to chime in with questions. The goal is to find the humanity in the character. Caricatures have difficulty holding up in the face of constant questioning, assuming that they're playing the exercise correctly and answering the questions honestly.

## SUMMARY

- Grounded setup establishes the world so the punchlines can flourish.

- Characters with relatability and thus humanity have longer lives because the audience can rally behind them. What makes your character human instead of a stereotype?
