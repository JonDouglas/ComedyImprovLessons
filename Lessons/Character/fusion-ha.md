# Fusion, Ha!

## DESCRIPTION

### Introduction

Mismatches are frequently interesting: when a person steps out of a tiny red Smart Car and you see that they're 6'6" tall; when a 90 lb kid beats the 300+ lb competitors in a eating competition; when the bespectacled person in the ill-fitting, nerdy clothes reveals a storied Krav Maga background as they defend themselves against street toughs. A method I've used to develop characters is to combine mismatched elements.

### Is This Difficult?

It could be. It really depends on what you're mixing together. Presumably, you'll be well-versed in the two elements you're combining. If you're not, well, then present the material confidently and you'll sound credible. The strongest mixes I've seen are usually between two elements that the performer happens to hold dear, that the improviser holds as passions outside of improvisation.

I didn't go this route with my first fusion character, but I was lucky in that the information that I did possess felt applicable enough to the material. I was able to convey the confidence that I otherwise would not have had if I weren't so fortunate.

I combined the elements of Medieval Knights in Western Europe and Asian Traditions in the East (by the way, I'm Asian, so my moves here were a little easier to stomach for anyone in the audience). The Chivalry of the West meets the Feng Shui of the East in the Asian Knight known as Bartholomew Chang.

Frankly, I had used Bartholomew before in a practice. I simply chose to become a Knight. It killed the first time, it was mediocre the second time. As a Knight, I felt I didn't have enough material to make it humorous. As I took to the stage in my first show, I was nervous. I wasn't sure how I was going to do. Bad Advice, the classic character advice panel game, was called. I stepped up and introduced myself. I decided to mix a little bit of me into the character and I added in the Asian Persuasion.  The fusion (ha) of knight and chi became much more than I bargained for, and it was one of my favorite characters to play.

It's all about _List Building_.

If you decide to create a fusion character on the spot, make sure that the two elements are disparate enough that the lists would be considered strange side-by-side. Then you start to find connections between the two to justify your responses. I would frequently begin to answer a question with the Knight portion of my character and finish it with the Asian portion, and vice-versa.

## EXERCISES

### Job Interview

One Player chooses two elements to fuse together into one character. Without telling anyone else, that Player comes in, greets the audience/class and is questioned about their place in the job. Typical job questions should be asked, like:

"Why do you think you'd be a good fit for our company?"

"Where do you see yourself in 5 years?"

"How would you describe yourself in 3 words?"

Afterwards, the audience/class should try to guess what two elements were fused. Discuss whether or not the fusion was successful.

## SUMMARY

- Mismatches are interesting. Try to mismatch things you're well-acquainted with so you worry less about the facts and can simply build bridges from the two elements.

- Try to choose elements that are different enough that finding connections is satisfying.
