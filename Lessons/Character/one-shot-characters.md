# One-Shot Characters

## DESCRIPTION

### Introduction

Certain characters have staying power and the audience loves to see them over and over again. Others... well, they might have received a good reaction the first time, but the times afterwards they have been received with groans from the audience. How do we know if a character can be used but once and then needs to be put in a shoebox and saved for a rainy day? The key is where the character's gimmick lies.

### One Bullet in the Chamber

There are many brilliant characters that can only be used once in a blue moon. Why is this? It's because the character's gimmick lies in a very shallow element, like a physical trait. 

Shallow Elements indicative of a _One-Shot Character:_

**Funny voice:** high/low pitch, good accent, strange way of talking

**Major physical posture**

**Shyamalan Twist:** generally happens at the end of a scene or the game, where the twist is revealed and the character's secret identity is revealed

**Very basic Game/Premise**

If the character ONLY has shallow traits propping it up as an interesting character, then it's probably a _One-Shot Character_ that should be used one in a while but cannot be repeated week-after-week (not that I would encourage repeating characters, but certain games may call for it).

Certain _One-Shot Characters_ can repeat for a while. This is usually because they have certain traits that prop up the shallow elements (and the shallow elements have been responded to well). I find that the _One-Shot Characters_ that maintain relevance and are more difficult to grow tired of are more a result of the commitment and skill of the performer rather than depth of the character itself. Perhaps that performer has honed the voice to the point that it's a treat to hear it, no matter how many times it's caressed your ears. Perhaps that performer has perfected that Game/Premise to the point that it's magic to see it being played in response to any question that is posed (a la Bad Advice).

### Cherishing It While It Lasts

_One-Shot Characters_ can generate enormous responses, so treat them with the respect they deserve. Though you won't have as much room to play with them, remember that you only get to play it for so long before it has to go back under your mattress with the questionable magazines and old stuffed animals. If you have the opportunity to bring one back, and you have brought it back, make sure you hit it as hard as you can! Give it everything you've got so people will remember it, and will yearn for its return.

Someday.

- _One-Shot Character_s can become stronger if the level of commitment and skill to the character is high. 

- If you can play a _One-Shot Character_, play it with all your heart, so people will remember its magnificence and eagerly await its return.
