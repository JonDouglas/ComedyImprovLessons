# Spontaneous Characters

## DESCRIPTION

### Introduction

Characters are some of the most memorable elements of an improv show. Good characters do a strong job of differentiating themselves from the actor portraying them. How do we form these characters on a whim?

### VAP

The basic character outline taught in many short form improv classes is VAP. It's a shortcut to creating a character on the spot, in which you choose one or more elements of the acronym and allow that to inform the rest of the character.

V: Voice

A: Attitude

P: Posture

Changing one's Voice can immediately create a distinctive character. This can be done with: 

**Accent or Dialect:** British, Southern, Pompous Rich Person  

**Pitch:** low voices to become more seductive, high voices to portray pubescent teens

**Tempo:** rapid speech to represent some sort of urgency or nervousness in a character, slow speech for confidence

If you've chosen a Voice that's particularly difficult, it may be helpful to anchor a phrase or even just a word that is that Voice personified. A friend of mine like to use "Vodka" whenever she uses a Russian accent, so if she slips away from the authentic Voice, she'll reference Vodka and it'll bring her back.

The Attitude of a character is a little more complex fundamentally but helps to inform your actions and developing the scene. You can either choose base level Attitude in general, or a specific point-of-view:

**Base Level Attitude:** Apathy, Motivated, Seductive, Loving, Considerate

**Specific Point-of-View:** "I am in love with my scene partner." "I will stop at nothing to become the richest person in the world."

These attitudes are fairly simple and can be brought into a scene as a baseline to further develop a character. You can use a phrase to anchor this attitude as well. Even if it's a Base Level Attitude, it's fairly easy to come up with a line that you can say that'll bring you back to the attitude. Apathy might be anchored with something like, "It doesn't matter," for instance.

Posture is perhaps the easiest to begin with. It simply requires you to change to way your body is positioned. This can be as extreme or as minute as you wish.

**Extreme Body Posture Changes: Hunchback, Amputee, Extreme limbs (need other player to do this with you), Centaur (also need other player to do this with you)

**Other Body Posture Changes:** Crossing a leg atop another (sitting), Stance changes (wide or close), Folded arms, Arm-in-a-sling, Cane, Holding an object (camera, sword)

**Facial Ticks:** Blinking (faster, slower, deliberate), Scrunching of the Nose, Chewing something (tobacco, gum, toothpick, food), Squinting, Eyebrow movements 

Posture is one of the strongest ways to anchor a character. If you find yourself slipping out of a character, reengaging yourself in the posture can keep you afloat. In one of my old characters, my anchor was simply to scrunch my face around the T-Zone, squint, then adjust/clean my glasses.

These are simply cookie cutter methods to start becoming a character. Allow the rest of the character to arrive after you've totally adopted one or more elements and you'll be good to go for a basic character.
