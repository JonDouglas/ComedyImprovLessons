# A to B

## Description

### Introduction

The key is that an idea is presented (usually by the audience in the form of a suggestion), then it's up to us improvisers to build upon that idea. As the phrase _A to B_ suggests, it should follow a relatively logical path without too extreme of a jump. _A to B_ is a key element of storytelling and conversation, so it's absolutely critical as far as improvisation is concerned.

Why is _A to B_ important?

_A to B_ sequencing is important because it makes it easier for the audience and our fellow players to follow the action. It creates a path of thought on which everyone can build ideas. When you have a coherent string of ideas, the scenes make sense, logically, and the ideas feel more natural than when making major jumps.

How to _A to B_

Forget about being funny and just think about what logically comes next. What's the first thing you think of when you hear a specific word?

Apple...

Then just say that next word. For me, Apple makes me think of Core. We probably didn't think of the same words, and that's okay. As long as you're staying true to the A, you're fine. It's pretty easy to see if someone is being disingenuous with _A to B_ because the connections are much more difficult to see.

## Examples

### Example 1 (Good)

Here's an _A to B_ chain that might develop from the word Apple.

Apple. Core. Uranium. Nuclear. Bomb. Pipe. Plumber. Crack. Drugs. DARE.

### Example 2 (Good)

Here's another _A to B_ chain that may develop from the word Apple.

Apple. Sauce. Alcohol. Bar. Courage. Dog. Allergic. Penicillin.

**Note:** Each player is not keeping all of the information, but rather going _A to B_ from the word they received on this journey. Apple + Core does not equal Uranium to me. I'm simply going from A to B, then A to B, then A to B. This keeps it simple for now.

### Example 3 (Bad)

Baseball. Hot Dog. Orange. Bun.

You can see here that there's a logical progression from _A to B_ and _A to B_ until we reach Orange and Bun. Perhaps the first thing the player thought of with Orange was in fact a bun, but upon questioning of him, I found that he had in fact connected with Hot Dog rather than Orange. This is a case in which _A to B_ has broken down because the player had not listened to the person transmitting an idea to him.

### Example 4 (Good)

Here is a scenic example of _A to B_ progression.

**Player A:** "I'm in love with you."

**Player B:** "But we can't be together."

**Player A:** "I don't care! I'm in love with you and I don't care what they say!"

**Player B:** "But our families..."

**Player A:** "Juliet..."

The Players have built upon each others statements with every line. The tension of not being able to be together and the mention of families both point to a story à la Romeo and Juliet.

### Example 5 (Bad)

**Player A:** "I'm in love with you."

**Player B:** "But we can't be together."

**Player A:** "I don't care! I'm in love with you and I don't care what they say!"

**Player B:** "I'm going to use a magic wand to transform us into different people so we can live in a different world in peace and harmony!"

Feels forced, doesn't it? The key here is that major jumps feel like one player is forcing the scene in a particular direction. Rather than following a logical path, it seems like Player B wanted to make something happen and just forced an idea into the scene. There's also the problem of wanting to fix the problem (Fix the Bike) immediately, but that's another lesson. The key takeaway here is that _A to B_ is conducive to building together, as we're taking in every bit of information given by our scene partners and moving sequentially through to the next step.

### Example 6 (EXCEPTION)

This example highlights a situation where _A to B_ is not necessarily the best choice: using a suggestion for an initiation.

**Suggestion:** Vacation!

Player A: "This is going to be the best vacation ever!"
...

I don't even want to continue this. Hah, nothing against something like that, but it feels forced, too. Sure, you're honoring the suggestion, but the audience is smarter than that. If you get a suggestion like vacation, feel free to allow that to inspire some feeling in you for your scene initiation. 

### Example 7 (Good)

Here's how I would take the suggestion of Vacation and use _A to B)_.

**Suggestion:** Vacation!

**Player A:** "Let's go to the next level."

**Player B:** "Wait... really?"

**Player A:** "Yeah! I... wasn't sure if the timing was right... but I feel really close to you right now."

**Player B:** "I don't know what to say. I mean, you're going really fast right now."

**Player A:** "Sure, a week might be rushing things, but I really like you."

**Player B:** "You're smothering me!"

**Player A:** "Please, honey, not in front of the natives!"

I allowed the suggestion to internalize itself in my mind for an initiation, whilst remembering that it's in my back pocket so I can pull it out whenever. When the scene started to become more tense, I whipped it out (the suggestion), which both honors the suggestion and provides more information about our relationship (mostly inferred), history (doesn't like fighting in public), and location (a trip elsewhere).

## Exercises

### A to B Writing/Daydreaming Exercise

You can do this alone or you can do it with others. Simply put, you need to find a word, a book, a sign, a tattoo or anything else you can find around you. That's your first word(**A word**). What does that first word make you think of? Okay, that's your new A(**B word**). Keep repeating this until you get a firm grasp on it.

## Summary

- A to B creates a coherent path for your teammates and the audience to follow.

- A to B is natural and allows for the humor in major jumps, after you've earned it.

- A to B is not necessary for a scene initiation. Keep the suggestion in your back pocket and figure it out.
