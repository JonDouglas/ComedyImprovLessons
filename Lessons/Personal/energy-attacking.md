# Energy and Attacking the Stage

## DESCRIPTION

### Introduction

Looking for a way to amp up your performances quickly and easily? Pour some **Energy** in it. It's like Sriracha. You can add more _effort_, more _energy_ into anything and it's like pumping Nitrous Oxide into a car. Remember, you're _playing_! Let that _play mentality_ guide you in your performance.

### Let's Run Around Like Lunatics!... NOT!

I'm not telling you to become the hyperactive, Tasmanian Devil, unfocused version of yourself (unless the scene calls for it, of course). The main point is that there are so many things you can do on stage, why not give it that little extra oomph? If you're sawing a piece of wood, put your actual arm muscles to use on that improvised 2x4. If you need to make a grand entrance, put your back into it (**DISCLAIMER** unless you have chronic back problems and can't do it **DISCLAIMER**) and make your movements as big as possible! The point is that every action matters, every movement counts, and thus you should put your all into those things. If you need to flip (and you're capable), then make that flip the best flip you've ever done.

This extends to your words as well. If you're angry and are compelled to yell in righteous fury, do so, and make the Devil himself quake with the thunder of your ferocity. If you're desperate for your loved one to return and are compelled to plead for her to turn back to you, wail with the tune and tone somberful enough to silence the sirens of the seas. 

Oftentimes these "Attacks" onto the stage amplify mundane moments into laugh points for the audience. I've received exclamations of surprise and interest with some of the physical things I've done on stage because of the conviction I used in executing them. I've received laughter on stage with relatively boring lines because of the power of my tone.

The key is effort. You get what you put in. I've performed with and seen players who no longer care about the performance. They can phone it in and get a chuckle, but you can tell that they don't want to be there. If they have to do something physical, they'll do it begrudgingly (actual begrudging rather than acting begrudging). If they have to react emotionally, it's clearly fake, but it sounds all right because of their experience. It's a **_privilege_** to be on stage. It's a **_privilege_** to make others laugh. It's a **_privilege_** to accompany such artists on stage. It's a **_privilege_** to play. 

Earn it.

### It's There In You

That feeling on Friday, where suddenly it's closing time and I get a surge of energy because I know that I'm free for the weekend! How's that work? I was exhausted and ready to nap around noon. Why do I feel great now? I don't know, but if you can relate to this, you know that you have energy reserves within you that are waiting to be accessed. Why not use them on stage? Why not give it everything you've got?

There's no magic formula to get into an energetic rhythm on stage. Everyone has their way of getting into a performance mindset. I challenge you to make your first move in a show a big one. Say that line in Caruso with conviction! Die in Understudy as though you were a regular on Days of Our Lives! It's less about finding a way to create energy for big moves, and more about making big moves to create energy.

## Summary

- It's a privilege to play. Earn it.
