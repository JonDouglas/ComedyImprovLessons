# Letting Go

## Description

### Introduction

You are not your shtick. You're so much more than that. You are not a label; you're not "the guy who always yells", "the woman who always plays women", "the quiet introvert". Not unless you want to be. It's improv. You have your life, you have your baggage. But this is improv. You're not "working improv". You're not "required to improv". You're **PLAYING**. You get to pretend to be that fuzz nozzle who cut you off in traffic. You get to pretend to be the Vigilante whose parents were killed and you've decided to take the path to protect the city. You get to pretend to be anything you want to be on stage. Why wouldn't you be that with everything you have?

### The Baggage

Your life inspires your improv. Your experiences inspire your improv. But you don't have to make your improv all about your life, especially if there's a particular thing that's been nagging you, or there's something in particular that's holding you back.

When you step into the theater, leave your baggage outside the door. That means your Ego, your sense of "hey, I need to maintain this image!" Think of Improv as being drunk, in a way. You're a performer. The things you do on stage aren't you. You're doing them for the show. You have the excuse of Improv as a reason to let yourself go free. There's a disconnect between acting and improvisation for some reason. Imagine if you were cast as a killer in a Steven Spielberg movie. Would you tell him that you quit the job because you have to portray a killer? Improvisers are actors. Your stage is your film. You're not being yourself, you're being whatever you need to be.

Let me get real for a second. I was in a workshop taught by Dave Razowsky and the exercise he was running took me on a journey involving my mother. I was extremely hesitant to go any further, to take the interesting route, because I was thinking of my real mother. He told me then, "remember that you're not you. She's not your mom. She's your character's mom." I was able to let go of the idea of my own mother to talk about assassinating my character's mother.

Now, I'm not advocating taking the dark road with every scene. I'm merely referencing that to say to you that, when you're on stage, you're not _you_. You have all your knowledge, you have all your experiences from which to draw, but you're not You! You are not "You Playing A Character". You _are_ that Character. Commit to that, or you will hate it. 

### Being "Cool"

In day-to-day life, we want to maintain a certain image. We may want to be known as "Nice", "Cool", "Hip", "Moral", "Kind", "Generous", "Attractive", etc. That's fine, I guess. But when you do improv, really think about whether or not these masks you wear are holding you back. Especially with the "Cool" mask. 

Everyone wants to be perceived as being "Cool," right? Without getting into a deep philosophical discussion about what "Cool" is, let's just say that everyone wants to be deemed "Cool" by the people they care about. Whether "Cool" is being a upstanding citizen, the funny person, or the magnanimous volunteer, let's just say that it's a standard of an image that people strive to uphold and maintain.

What does being "Cool" do for you? What does working to maintain your "Coolness" do for you? Does all that really matter? Do the people whom you want to think of you as "Cool" actually matter?

Maintaining an image for others is detrimental to our craft. When you want to be seen in a certain way, you're internally typecasting yourself into specific roles. Improv doesn't work that way. 

What happens if you want to be the cool, suave John Travolta in Grease character and someone calls you, "Nerd," "Grandma," or "Jennifer?" You wanted to be Danny, Dammit! Are you going to block? I've seen it before. "I'm not Jennifer! I'm Danny!" 

What happens if you're comfortable playing polite and nice because you want people to think you're a good person? What if someone decides to call you a "Jerk," "Douchebag," or "Trump?" You wanted to be polite and nice! Are you going to play it, but play it halfheartedly? "Yeah, let's build a wall! But, maybe we don't have to kick anyone out..."

Both of the above choices will illicit a groan. Sure, the negation of Jennifer into Danny may get you a laugh, but you've undermined the credibility of your scene partner entirely for that cheap laugh. Was it worth it? 

Sure, you get to stay polite and nice while "playing Trump," but you're not playing Trump, you're being yourself and misquoting Trump. If the suggestion was "Trump if he was a nicer guy," then you're honoring the suggestion, but if it was just "Trump" then you've spat in the suggestion's face. 

It's hard to let go of yourself, I know. It's hard to do things that you think will make you look silly, ugly, obnoxious, promiscuous, stupid, conceited, heartless, or any other adjective that describes the type of character you're afraid to become. So think of it as an acting role. Whomever you think will judge you, they won't. They know you're acting. They know you as a person. They know you aren't like that in real life. Anyone watching theater and expecting Jean Valjean's Actor to be a French convict turned altruist as well, is about to face some harsh truths in this world. You have the pass. You have my permission. Go up there and do something out of your comfort zone. The first time's the hardest. The second's even harder. But you keep doing it, over and over again, until finally you feel like you're good with everything anyone can throw at you. Then they throw it at you and you're thrown for a loop. But you do it anyway. Why? Because it'll work out. It has worked out, and it will work out.

### Commitment

After the first step of taking a big leap into uncharted territory, now we need to talk about running back from the dark. Oftentimes a new player will dip their toe into the pond of the unknown, find it a little colder than imagined, then run back to safety. The idea of maintaining an artificial image seems to prevent one from committing fully to an idea. Most commonly it is shown in a lack of confidence in a suggestion or a joke. 

A poor joke delivered fantastically will get a better reaction from the audience than a fantastic joke delivered poorly. A key element to any comedian is that he/she/they commit to their bits, like they were showing off their kids. As improvisers, we must commit to our roles, even if they were initially poorly received, or any hope of salvaging it will be lost. 

## Examples

Here are some examples of poor commitment and vulnerability in day-to-day life. How we extend a toe of vulnerability into the water and then run back to the comfort of the beach towel when we find a colder than expected response. 

### Example 1 (Bad)

**Person A:** "Hey, what do you think of Solar Energy?" (Is actually excited about Solar Energy)

**Person B:** "I think it's a huge waste."

**Person A:** "Oh, yeah (is clearly disappointed about this, wanted to talk about it), it's kinda stupid, isn't it?"

### Example 2 (Bad)

**Person A:** "A donut!" (punchline)

**Person B:** *silence* 

**Person A:** "That was dumb. I heard it from ______." (would clearly have taken credit for it if it landed)

### Example 3 (Bad)

**Person A:** "I like you." (hopeful)

**Person B:** *uncomfortable silence* "Uhh... " 

**Person A:** (hurries to say) "April Fool's!"

We have no room for this in improv. If you make a move, it's significant. Don't backpedal. Commit to whatever you're going for. If you're being a character you're uncomfortable with and you're tiptoeing with it, you will be eaten alive by the audience. Remember, you're not yourself when you're improvising. 

## Exercises

### Let it go

This exercise focuses purely on being able to let go of something in your life.

- Observe a painful memory. Acknowledge that emotions exist around this memory.

- Concentrate on a specific emotion with that memory. Analyze what that emotion says about that memory.

- Know that you are not your emotion. Your emotion is part of you, but it is not all of you. You are much bigger than your emotion.

- Love your emotions. Embrace the fact that you can love even your most painful emotions.

## Summary

- Leave Your Baggage at the door, but come armed with all the knowledge you have to bear. 

- You're the Character. You're not You. You're not "You Playing that Character." 

- Commit to the Character.

- If you were in a major motion picture, would you say "No!" to doing that thing? Then why would you say "No!" on stage?

- Sticking with a character or bit leads to higher chances of success than giving up midstream.
