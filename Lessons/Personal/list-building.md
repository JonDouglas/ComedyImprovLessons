# List Building

## DESCRIPTION

### Introduction

"How do they think of so many things! They're so clever! I wish I could be that fast! That Matt guy on stage is so hot!" 

Sound familiar? Probably, except for that last one (a guy can dream, eh?). Anyway, the reason improvisers can "come up with" so many things on the spot is that we've trained _List Building_. This is the skill of writing a mental checklist of things related to the task at hand. If we're playing Caruso, I build lists about crimes first. The Emcee asks for suggestions and I build lists as I hear each word. These lists are bouncing around my head as we play the game, so different combinations in the forms of jokes can form.

### _List Building_ Is Gross

_List Building_ sounds daunting, doesn't it? Some people relish it, while others think of it as a chore. So I would like to submit to you a different way of looking at _List Building_: _List Building_ is all about recall.

The human brain holds so much information but we only need a little bit of it at a time for a game. Thankfully, we get the categories from the audience and our fellow players. We're not trying to create all of this information out of thin air. It's all in your head already. It's just a matter of getting rid of the unnecessary information.

### NO WRONG ANSWERS

There are no wrong answers when you're building a list. It's not like you're trying to write out a list of spelling words for the 1st grade. You're simply chiseling away the bits that you don't need, bringing out the Venus de Milo you want to use in your improvisation.

This is very much a Brainstorm. Don't shoot down and judge your ideas as you go through your _List Building_. Just recognize the things that are related. Who knows, you might pass on a word that seems like it's too far off base, then come back to it as it relates to another word that you discover along the way.

### KING OF LINE GAMES

Frankly, every single line game can be played well with good _List Building_. When you hear the game, you can immediately begin your list.

**EMCEE:** "We're going to be playing Caruso!"

(Player starts building list of words related to murder, crime, investigations)

**EMCEE:** "We're going to be playing Pick Up Lines!"

(Player starts building list of words related to dating, love, romance, sex, body parts)

Then, when you start hearing suggestions being yelled out, more and more lists can be created.

**EMCEE:** "I need some professions!"

**Audience:** "Proctologist! Doctor! Dog-Walker! Janitor!"

(Player starts building list of words related to Doctor, Dog-Walker, and Janitor [okay, maybe Proctologist, too, depending on where your show lies on the Movie rating scale; the point is that you build lists based on suggestions that are likely to be taken, hopefully your Emcee will repeat ones he/she/they likes before the game begins so you can get a headstart])

The key to line games is simply to build lists related to the game, build lists related to the suggestion, then find ways to connect the lists. Puns and double entendres will both find their way into your performance through making these connections.

## EXAMPLES

### EXAMPLE 1

Here's an example of what goes through my mind when I receive a suggestion.

Suggestion is Basketball

Bounce. NBA. Tall. Jumping. Dunk. Dunk Contest. 3 Pointer. Assists. Rebounds. Michael Jordan. Lebron James. Stephen Curry. Defense. Offense. High school. Junior High. Try outs. Throwing Up. Conditioning.

And so on.

These are all in my head so that I can draw upon them immediately. It just takes a little recall. 

### EXAMPLE 2 

Let's go through an example of a topic I don't know very well.

Suggestion is Astrophysics

Astro suggests Space. Physics is a science. Space Science. NASA. Black Holes. Constellations. Astrology. Meteoroids or Meteorites? Asteroids? Trajectories. Armageddon.

Even though I have virtually no knowledge of Astrophysics, I can still build a list. 

### EXAMPLE 3 (SCENE WORK)

Whenever you begin a scene, you have the opportunity to make lists. You're just doing it extremely quickly with everything that's heard, said, seen, and felt. You might not even realize it's happening. 

"I need two up! Your suggestion is Pineapple."

(Players begin _List Building_ off Pineapple: tropical fruit, spiky, need to cut, sour and sweet, harsh on your teeth, Hawaiian pizza, vacation)

**Player A:** "Honey, I want you to rub lotion on my back."

(**Player B** _List Building_: 

Honey: Relationship? 

Romantic - Spouses, Girlfriend/boyfriend, Girlfriend/Girlfriend, Boyfriend/boyfriend; 

Familial - Father/Daughter, Father/Son, Mother/Daughter, Mother/Son, Grandparent/grandson, Grandparent/granddaughter

Rubbing lotion: 

Beach? Suntan lotion

Not beach? Jergens, Baby Magic, Olay

"He's laying on his chest, back exposed. So I think he's at the beach. If we're at the beach and he's saying that he wants me to rub lotion on his back, we're probably a couple of some sort. He's not asking, so we're closer than a new relationship. He's being very clear and not saying it matter of factly ["Get my back, will ya?"], so it doesn't seem like we've been married for ages. But his directness seems to suggest that I would not be interested in doing that. Maybe I have a problem with intimacy? Specifically in public. So maybe public displays of affection are a problem for me. I can play that.")

**Player B:** (kneels down next to Player A) "Uhh... but there are other people around..."

(**Player A** _List Building_: [much shorter, I'm making the assumption that the initial _List Building_ was done on **Player A's** side as well]

Other people around: Why does he have a problem with this?

Relationship? - Awkward request from a parent/grandparent?

Romantic? - Intimacy issues in Public? 

"Her Proximity suggests that we may be in a romantic relationship. An unruly teenager would probably still be standing and maintaining distance. If we're in a romantic relationship, she probably has issues with Public Displays of Affection. So I can play on that. 

Public Displays of Affection: Mushy pet names, hugging, kissing, handholding, tandem bikes, feeding each other, tickling, cuddling, couple discounts)

**Player A:** "What's the matter, Pookie" (gets up to his knees and uses one finger to tickle her chin)

(**Player B:** "So we're on the same page of being in a romantic relationship where I have problems with Public Displays of Affection. The game is that he's going to do more and more PDAs and I'm going to be increasingly uncomfortable/embarrassed

Uncomfortable/Embarrassed: Look around constantly to see if anyone's watching, closed body language, laughing uncomfortably to ease tension, bat away physical touch, turn away, avoid situations where we might touch, create defenses to stop it [wearing a big coat at the beach], excuses to not hold hands, justifications to explain everything away so it's no longer romantic) 

You see, every single scene can be broken down into _List Building_. When you're in the moment, of course, you're not thinking about all of this consciously, but subconsciously you're chiseling away the bits of the scene that don't belong. With every line, every movement, every reaction, you figure out exactly what lists are relevant and what lists can be discarded.

## Exercises

### Grocery List

Writing/Daydreaming Exercise

You can do this alone at any time. Simply grab a word for inspiration and then build a list mentally or physically in written word related to that inspirational word. Doing this often will train your brain so you, too, can go through all sorts of lists in the blink of an eye as you stare through the blinding stage lights.

## Summary

- Matt is hot. (Just making sure you're paying attention)

- You have all the information, you're simply making it readily accessible to you in the moment.

- Break down games into simply multiple lists.

- You're chiseling away the stuff that is not necessary in the moment.
