# Listen Up

## Description

### Introduction

Listening is everything. Listening to everything. It's not just the words and sounds you hear, but the subtext and tone within those words and sounds; the posture of your scene partner; the proximity of your scene partner to you, to the wall, to the audience; everything you can see; everything you can hear; everything you can feel, touch, smell, or sense otherwise. If you're not listening, you're not improvising with your scene partner.

### Listening in Depth

Listening is the most important element of improv. Most of the issues I see in improvisers, beginning and intermediate alike, could be easily solved with better listening. Misunderstandings of characters, using the wrong name, making incongruous decisions, even basic moves that block and deny might be due to a breakdown in listening.

So let's do a breakdown _of_ listening, rather than in.

The easiest to grasp the element of listening is in the ears. Of course, that's what they're there for, right? But what are we listening for when we're in a scene? Text and Subtext (AKA, the Prose and Poetry of speaking)

**Text:** The words that are actually spoken.

**Subtext:** The meaning in between the words that have been spoken. The unspoken words.

The first and easiest step in Listening is hearing the words. *"I love you"* is a simple phrase. If you don't absorb the subtext of the situation, then it seems like everything's pretty fine, doesn't it? The text is merely a vehicle used to express the subtext. It is the fork to your falafel, the spoon to your Sicilian soup, the chopsticks to your chow mein. 

This is a reason why listening to computer generated voices is so jarring. They lack the subtext, the emotion that carries through in the words that are spoken. This is also why so many transactional interactions in day-to-day life are so boring. We seem to have removed subtext from phrases that are designed to promote human connection. "How are you doing?" "Good." Neither the questioner nor the answerer are invested in this interaction. The people are spouting words that mean nothing because they've chosen to pull the meaning from those words. This is an understandable choice, because autopilot is comfortable. We don't have to put any extra energy into those interactions. We can go about life, living mundanely under the uncaring guise of Customer Service. Just don't get stuck in that mode because words without the meaning behind them are not words you want to use on stage nor in your personal relationships.

Subtext. Finally, we have the salad, the soup, the chow mein! This is the crux of everything you say. This is difficult to illustrate through simple text, but the major element of communicating and listening lies in subtext. I can tell you that "I love you," but it's all about everything else that determines how you would perceive that. 

- What's our relationship like? 

- What sort of person am I? 

- What sort of person are you? 

- How do the words come out of my mouth? 

- What is my body doing as I say those words? 

- Why am I saying them now?

- What am I _not_ saying?

**Subtext is the key.** When you listen to someone say something, you need to pay attention to _how_ they're saying it in order to get the idea of what they really want. 

***"I'm a strong, independent person."***

This could be a declaration of strength. But would a person who is indeed strong and independent have to say so? Why is he saying this? Does he want encouragement? Does he want help? Does he want someone to tell him that it's okay to need help from time-to-time? Does he want acknowledgment of his deeds in addition to help?

Subtext is the difficult part of Listening, because it has to do with everything below the surface. It requires a lot of assumptions. Most of the time, people are afraid to make those assumptions. As improvisers, don't be afraid to make those assumptions.

## Examples

### Example 1

**Text:** "I'm in love with you."

**Subtext:** "I want you to stay. I'm telling you that I'm in love with you, even though I'm not, but I don't want you to go."

Now, if we knew exactly the subtext in a conversation like this, we know exactly what we need to do, as human beings, to satisfy that character's want. We simply need to stay. We know that he's lying. We know that he just wants us to stay. So we stay and the want is satisfied.

But remember, we're not here to fix the bike. Oh, no. Sorry, dude, we're not going to stay. That would destroy the tension. We accept the reality that he said, ***"I'm in love with you."*** We accept that the subtext is telling us that he just wants us to stay. Now, it's up to us to provide tension in response.

### Example 2

**Text:** *"I don't want you."*

**Subtext:** *"I am in love with you, but I can't be around you because it's unhealthy for us."*

Recognize that this is much simpler on paper right now. You can't be absolutely certain of someone's subtext. You can have a pretty close idea of what someone's trying to say in what they're not saying, but you can't be sure. It's up to you to make the assumption, play off of it, and trust that both of you will support each others assumptions.

You see the difficulty here? As improvisers, we make the interesting choice. We hear the text, assume the subtext, and then take it to the next layer. That next layer is the want of the actor. As improvisers, we strive to be interesting. In order to be interesting, every step and every choice is geared to create that tension that people want to see. So if we look at that example again, we can break it down into three layers.

### Example 3

**Player A**:

**Text:** *"I'm in love with you."*

**Subtext:** *"I want you to stay. I'm telling you that I'm in love with you, even though I'm not, but I don't want you to go."*

**Actor's Want:** *"I need you to leave me."*

**Player B**:

**Text:** *"I don't want you."*

**Subtext:** *"I am in love with you, but I can't be around you because it's unhealthy for us."*

**Actor's Want:** *"I need you to need me to stay."*

Once you get to that third layer, you have a tension, a game, that the two of you can continue to play. But in order to get there, you need to Listen.


## Exercises

### I Spy (Two or more)

Have everyone pair up. They are to look at their partner for about 30 seconds and then close their eyes. Now they take turns to recite every little detail about their partner's physical appearance (stick to clothing, facial hair, etc. so feelings aren't hurt).

This exercise is about taking in your partner. This takes it a bit literally, as you're focusing on elements that would not be exactly the same in scene, but it serves the purpose of paying attention to your scene partner.

### Mute (Two players)

Receive a suggestion for a location and then have both players establish the setting through pantomime. After the location has been established, have the two players look at each other, initiating contact and the scene itself without expressing any words. Each player is then questioned:

- What do you know about your scene partner? 

- What do you know about your relationship?

- What do you know about this situation?

Why? should be asked for all of these, especially if there's a very specific response.

### Line-By-Line Listening (Two or more)

Have one player initiate a scene with a line and then Freeze. As the Coach, ask the receiving player the following questions:

- What do you know about your scene partner?

- What do you know about yourself?

- What do you know about the situation at hand?

- What is your scene partner's character saying?

- What does your scene partner's character want?

- What does your scene partner want?

Now recap for the receiving player the important bits of what he/she/they said. That's the reality that has been offered. 

Now have the receiving player respond to the initiating line. Ask the First Player the same questions.

- What do you know about your scene partner?

- What do you know about yourself?

- What do you know about the situation at hand?

- What is your scene partner's character saying?

- What does your scene partner's character want?

- What does your scene partner want?

Continue line-by-line so the players are focused on analyzing everything that's been said, verbally and otherwise, by their scene partner.

## Summary

- Listening is the most important thing.

- If there was a miscommunication among actors in the show, it was likely due to a lack of focus on Listening.

- Listening is more than just hearing the text. Subtext is everything beyond the text. Take in everything. Body language, proximity, tone, words that aren't being said.
