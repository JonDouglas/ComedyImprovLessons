# Living Life and How It Helps Improv

## Description

### Introduction

Improv is inspired from life. Our overall goal whenever we take to the stage is to make our scene partners look like geniuses. A crucial part of being a good scene partner in pursuit of this goal is to live life. Living life fully, living life as an improviser, will help generate material in the form of experience for us to access on stage when it's needed. **DISCLAIMER: The rest of this article is based on my life, as a 25 year-old, single (marital status), improviser. Other life circumstances may not allow for the following, nor do I think it's necessary for everyone. This is simply how I move through life to best inform my improvisation.**

### Why Not Just Do Improv?

Frankly, I hit a wall in which I was doing so much improv every week that I neglected everything else in life. It was all improv, all the time. I didn't go out and do anything else (hanging out with friends, trying new things, learning new skills, meeting new people). I wanted to get better at improv, so I put my head in the improv sand and I just did it all the time. I lived it, I breathed it, I made sweet, sweet love to it. The problem here is that Life _is_ improv at its core. I was neglecting Life.

My scenes suffered. I was burning out. The juice from which I was drawing my scenes had run out and I was informing them from other scenes I had seen or done. When my improv was informed by the improv of others, I lost a sense of realism: everything was hyperbolic. I fell into the habit of wanting to improve on everything, all the time. I fell into the habit of fearing failure. These habits create ruts. I found myself trying to reuse characters, reuse scene ideas that worked in the past. It wasn't improv anymore. It was disingenuous.

This disingenuous improv is harmful to the soul of improv. When I told people that I'm making it up on the spot, but I was lying, it hurt. I wasn't playing honestly. It became work to try to maintain this horrible image of myself. I was stuck in a state of mediocre improv and clung to it by doing the same stuff over and over again.

### How to Break It

#### Live Life

First, take a breath. Next, take a break. Improv is great, but remember that Life is improv. Every moment you're interacting with someone is "On-The-Spot." Sure, we have our specific sequences that we have created to move from moment to moment with certainty: 

*"Hi. Oh, I'm good, you? Good! Have a nice day!"*

And none of that matters. None of that was the truth. It was a superficial interaction and a superficial connection. If you feel like you need to work on your improv all the time, then ***Live Life***. Life is the grandest stage for improv. Life is what improv seeks to imitate. The most interesting bits of life are the bits that we draw upon to captivate the audience. 

#### Conversation and Introversion

The first thing I did to break out of my rut of improvising all the time was to Live all the time. Whenever I go to the store, I do my best to break the pattern above. I stay in the moment and notice things I can bring up in conversation. I ask common questions about the nature of one's work. I end up laughing with cashiers, clerks, custodians and the like because I stayed in the moment and I improvised with them. I've learned so much about life because I was willing to ask a few questions, I was willing to put aside my comfort and talk for a while. 

I recognize that it's not easy for everyone. As far as personality types go, I recognize that Introverts will worry about this step. I also recognize that I'm classified as an Introvert. In 99% of the personality tests I've taken (1% was in a bit of a high state, so I don't think I can count that one), I've been classified as an Introvert. But, I don't like labels. I don't like to give Myers and Briggs the opportunity to dictate my life from their "Fill-In-The-Bubble" high horse. This is something I worked on. I got angry at the classification. I got angry at myself for not having the courage to talk to people. I read books and practiced their techniques everywhere so that I could develop the skills to break through my label and live life. 

It gets easier. It always does. But in the course of it getting easier, it will become harder first. 

It's worth it.

#### Trying New Things

I have never written a Bucket List, physically. I think of things I want to do and I file them away in my head for some rainy day, possibly to never be done until I'm in my early forties, with a lot of life before me, and a moment comes that stops me on a dime. I understand that life is busy, with work, family, romance, social lives, ambitions, etc., but remember that trying new things doesn't necessarily have to conflict with those things. Doing something like Skydiving may require a big break from the regularly scheduled programming, but other activities can be implemented fairly easily in the course of spending time with the people you care about.

Going on a date? Go take that cooking class.

Going on a vacation? Do something a little crazier than the usual Las Vegas/Disneyland/Universal Studios destination (especially if you do this on a regular basis).

Mother's Day? Plan a fun activity of a painting class or something instead of the usual card and flowers.

The main point of this section is simply that **Trying New Things** isn't necessarily difficult, but it does require Awareness. One needs to acknowledge routines and be willing to break free of said routines in order to experience life fully.

#### Constant Vigilance!

*"All the world's a stage, and all the men and women merely players..."* If you approach life with this mentality, you can learn so much that will inform your improv. Rather than daydreaming through the line at Starbucks, or looking at Instagram while downing that mocha latte, keep an eye on everything around you, as if that location is the stage. You may see something interesting transpiring, or you may just see Life as it's unfolding. Watching someone work on my coffee has given me so much material for the process of pantomiming as a barista. Watching a chef man his station and order his sous chefs around has given me so much material for the hierarchical setup of a kitchen. Everything around you can help with your improv, as long as you allow it to.

This process not only helps inform material on stage, but it could make the above processes of interacting with others and Trying New Things much, much easier. Seeing something happen can easily push you into saying a few nice words to the cashier, which may turn his day around completely.

### Final Thoughts

As improvisers, we bring all of our knowledge, our experiences, our emotions, and our intellect to the stage. To be the best scene partner, to best support and make our teammates look golden, we must bring everything we can to the stage. The more we live life, the more we experience, the more we can bring to the stage and provide as fuel to the scene.

## Examples

### Example 1

This is merely as example of informing scenework with life experience.

**Player A:** (Remembers that time they went to Montreal during St. Baptiste day - Also known as a Midsummer Festival)

**Player A:** It looks like this festival is really ramping up.

**Player B:** James do you remember when you entered that hotdog eating contest last year?

**Player A:** Pft, of course I remember it Fred. I couldn't look at a hotdog without puking afterwards.

**Player B:** But James, you won that contest. You should do it again. I hear they are giving out a years supply of Oscar Meyer Bologna to the winner.

**Player A:** (Starts to pretend to puke)

**Player A:** Oh god, did you just say Oscar Meyer? I can't even listen to those words without thinking about puking.

## Exercises

### Go do something

There's no exercise for this lesson. Simply go out and experience life. Go try something new that you would normally not. Here's a short list of things you can be doing right now:

- Fall in love

- Get your heartbroken

- Move to another location

- Get fired

- Find yourself in a hole that might be hard to get out of

- Travel the world

Go collect life experiences.

## Summary

- Don't let your improv be the stuff that informs your improv. Live Life and allow Life to inform your improv.

- Try new things.

- Observe the stage of Life as it happens all around you.
