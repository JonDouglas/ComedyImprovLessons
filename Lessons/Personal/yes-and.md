# Yes And

## Description

### Introduction

Anyone who's been on Facebook and has had a friend in Improv has seen the little graphics that show _Yes, And_ accompanied by a pleasing font and woodwork. _Yes, And_ is one of the biggest concepts in Improv. Don't take the phrase literally and use it in every scene, or you'll become _Yes, And_ + Man/Woman/Boy/Girl/Robot/Alien/Etc. Although that might be a fun character to play for an improv audience, it gets old fast.

### Diving In

The phrase _Yes, And_ is considered to be one of the most important principles of improv. The main idea is that you:

1. **Yes** - Accept the reality offered by your scene partner

2. **And** - Build onto the reality offered by your scene partner.

Again, this doesn't mean you say _Yes, And_ in response to everything your partner says. It's just a matter of not denying the reality and always adding information.

## Examples

### Example 1 (Good)

_**Player A** seems to be pulling off small pieces of something_

_**Player B** doesn't know what **Player A** is doing and is observing_

**Player A:** "Give me that glue, would you?"

**Player B:** "All right. (hands glue to **Player A**) Wow, Gorilla Glue, fancy! You really take this seriously, don't you?"

**Player A:** "Well, I'm pretty passionate about my hobbies. You'll find that I'm just that kind of woman.... and I'm good with my hands." (winks at **Player B**)

**Player A** asked for glue and **Player B** complied. When it comes to something basic like that, just do the action. You can make a small game out of not giving the guy the object, but think about how shallow that is. It's the easy game, that everyone can play, but remember that only superficial arguments will come about when you choose to fight over something small like that.

You do have the choice to give it to them in a certain manner that provides more information, though. Do it in a disgruntled manner. Do it in a subservient, eager-to-please manner. Do it in a loving, maternal manner. Do it in a sensual, arousing manner. All of that gives information. You could just give it in a normal manner and allow the rest of the scene to develop as well. It's improv, it's up to you.

**Player B** then adds information by being impressed by the choice of glue _(tone doesn't translate well to the written format, so I'll let you know if someone's being sarcastic; let's say that **Player B** was being friendly in mentioning this)_. **Player B**'s next sentence "You really take this seriously, don't you?" suggests that **Player B** doesn't know about **Player A**'s hobby, so either **Player A** is secretive about it (probably not because of the current situation and how casual the two are), or **Player B** is not that well acquainted with **Player A**.

**Player A** then builds on this by admitting that she is passionate about her hobbies. "You'll find that I'm just that kind of woman..." suggests that she plans on **Player B** becoming more acquainted with **Player A**'s passions. The wink afterwards along with the flirty "and I'm good with my hands" suggests that the two may be romantically interested in one another and the scenario could be a date of some sort.

Each of these lines, each of these moves, accepted the reality and gave more information to the players and the audience. We have a general idea of the relationship, the activity, the mood of the moment, and background information about **Player A** (passionate about hobbies, works with her hands, not afraid of **Player B** in a romantic sense [was willing to give the order to grab the glue, flirted openly]) and **Player B** (doesn't know that much about glue because he thinks Gorilla Glue is fancy, or does know and is simply being nice [either because of politeness or because he's interested in her]).

### Example 2 (Bad)

(**Player A** seems to be pulling off small pieces of something)

(**Player B** doesn't know what **Player A** is doing and is observing)

**Player A**: "Give me that glue, would you?"

**Player B**: "Glue doesn't exist."

This is a clear block. **Player A** is referencing glue that she is aware of (saying "that glue" instead of "some glue"). **Player B** is saying that "Glue doesn't exist," which undermines **Player A**'s statement of glue being there, and further undercuts the idea by attempting to destroy glue's existence in the scene. Of course, there are ways to play with this, but there are so many hurdles to overcome that it's easier to employ _Yes, And_. Besides, if glue didn't exist, one would generally not say that it doesn't, but rather question what it is, unless it's a conspiracy against **Player A** and **Player B** slipped up.

This doesn't mean that you can never say "No." This doesn't mean that you can't object to something your scene partner said. Let me show you some examples.

(**Player A** and **Player B** are on stage)

**Player A**: "Give me all your money"

**Player B**: "No."

This isn't a block. **Player A** just told **Player B** to give him the money, and **Player B** wasn't convinced. In this scenario, "No" is not a block. **Player A** hasn't given **Player B** any reason to comply. Perhaps if **Player A** showed himself as a physically imposing character, or if he whipped out a gun, then maybe **Player B** would comply. But he also might not, for some justifiable reason. The key here is that **Player A** said "Give me all your money," **Player B** knows the reality is that **Player A** said that, and **Player B** has decided to say "No."

A key element in recognizing if you're accepting the reality is tone. You don't really know what your partner is thinking but you can make an educated guess based on his/her/their body language, tone, and the nature of the request.

There's an old adage in improv that says, "If I want something, don't let me have it." This adage does not stand in opposition to _Yes, And_, because _Yes, And_ is an overarching concept concerning the improvisers themselves. _Yes, And_ means that we each accept the reality given to us by our scene partners and we will continue to build on it. If I, as a character, want your love, recognize that, as an actor, I want you to withhold it. Otherwise, the scene is over, right?

### Example 3a (Good)

**Player A**: (with a sense of desperation) "I want you to love me."

**Player B**: "Mmm.... nah, nice try."

### Example 3b (Bad)

**Player A**: (with a sense of desperation) "I want you to love me."

**Player B**: (thinking) "I need to say Yes!"

**Player B**: "Okay, I love you."

In the first scene (Example 3a), **Player B** says "nah." This isn't a block because it's a direct response to **Player A**'s intent. The desperation suggests that **Player A** wants the love, **Player B** has not shown that level of interest in **Player A**, and **Player A** is afraid of rejection. **Player B**, in saying "No" to the character, is saying "Yes" to the actor. Now we have tension, a game to play, in which **Player A** is trying to convince **Player B**, while **Player B**'s job is to remain unconvinced.

In the second scene (Example 3b), **Player B** says "Okay" in an effort to Yes And. But then, we need to find the tension/game in the scene somehow, right? So where do we go from there? We can go anywhere, true, but it feels like we've immediately dismissed the offer. We had a potential tension/game already and we pushed past it by saying "Yes" to the character and not saying "Yes" to the actor.

## Exercises

### People Watching (1 or more)

I do this on my own, but it's probably more fun to do it with a partner like in those date scenes in a movie.

Sit somewhere in a mall and look at people. When you see someone, take in the way they walk, the way they carry themselves, their stride, their smile, everything you can muster. Then, make up a story about them. I'll give you a template to start:
Job:

- What does he/she/they do?

- Is he/she/they good at it?

- What's work like for them?

Hobby:

- What is it?

- Is he/she/they good at it?

Marital Status:

- Single?

- Relationship?

What's the house like?:

- Dirty?

- Clean?

Dreams and aspirations?:

- Are they living them?

- Why or why not?

Name:

You don't need to follow the template, just make sure that you continue to build on the information.

#### People Watching Example

**Player A**: Okay, he's an accountant.

**Player B**: Yeah, he doesn't like it... but he doesn't like dealing with people so he chose it.

**Player A**: He's not great at it, and he's terrified of people finding out.

**Player B**: Work is okay. He keeps his head down because more conversation scares him because of the possibility that someone's going to bring up that mistake from the last quarterly statement.

**Player A**: He likes to race on weekends.

**Player B**: He spends his time tricking out his Nissan Skyline. He spends way too much money on it, but it's his chance to show off, especially for the girls at the track.

**Player A**: He's way too good at drag racing. It's seeping into his daily life. He got pulled over on the way to work for racing from stop light to stop light. The other guy lost the race but didn't get pulled over.

**Player B**: He's single because he's afraid of looking stupid in front of people.

**Player A**: He wants to be the Cool Guy but doesn't think he can. He fantasizes about dating that girl in the indie coffee shop he goes to before work.The coffee is terrible but it's an excuse to talk to her.

**Player B**: If you can call "One small mocha. Here you go. Thank you. You, too." to be talking to her.

And so on and so forth. I loved seeing this in a sitcom and I've applied it to my own life. If you're alone, see if you can write down those details, so you have a reference point to go back to. Heck, write them down if you're with someone, too, just make sure you're both still contributing to the story (two people building rather than one person taking dictation)

### Talking It Through (2 players)

Requires a Coach who already understands the concept

**Player A** initiates a scene with one line and then Freeze the scene. Ask **Player B**:

What has been established? What do you know about this scene from that initiation?

Have **Player B** respond and then Freeze the scene. Ask **Player A**:

What has been established? What do you know about this scene from that response?

Continue line-by-line. This forces each player to pay close attention to everything that's happened prior and makes them respond in light of that information.

## Tips & Tricks

## Summary

- _Yes, And_ is a concept and the literal words are a trap.

- Accept Reality and Build Onto It.

- Building information lies not only in the words, but in the tone, the body language, the overall subtext.

- Saying "No" can be a _Yes, And_.
