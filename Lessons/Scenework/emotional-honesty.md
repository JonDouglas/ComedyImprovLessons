# Emotional Honesty

## DESCRIPTION

### Introduction

When something happens to us, around us, or as a result of us, we react emotionally. It's reflexive and occurs before we can even think about it. Now, our actual physical reactions may be wildly different from that first impulse because of the circumstances of the situation, but the initial emotional reaction is there. In improv, you have the opportunity to use that first impulse and build it, to show the audience the interesting choices in life.

## EXAMPLES

If a player is making a choice that is designed to affect the other player, it is up to that player receiving the information to react to it emotionally. This is not to say that the Receiver must overreact to anything that is said. This is a two-way street: it's up to the Sender to make a choice significant enough to impact the Receiver. If the choice doesn't have enough of an impact, than the roles are reversed, in which the Sender now reacts to the Receiver not being affected by the choice.

### Example 1 (Sending and Receiving)

**Player A (Sender):** "I don't like peas."

**Player B (Receiver):** "Okay."

**Player A (Sender-turned-Receiver):** "You don't care?"

**Player B (Receiver-turned Sender):** "No... Should I?"

**Player A (Sender-turned-Receiver):** "Well, I mean, I thought you would try to defend my honor."

I'm not going to continue this example in this fashion because the labels are already convoluted. The point is that we're trying to say things to affect the other person. If it doesn't, we should be affected by that. But this doesn't mean that one player is always the Sender and the other player is always the Receiver. In the example above, the line "Well, I mean, I thought you would try to defend my honor" would probably illicit some sort of reaction from Player B. It might be incredulity, it might be anger, or Player B might continue along the path and simply say, "oh," to which Player A would continue to react.

### Emotional Reaction is Building, Too

We all need to _Yes, And_ the reality, recognizing everything that has been established and continuing to build upon that. This principle is incredibly relevant in Give and Take, but we need to realize exactly what building upon something actually is. Let's look at an example:

### Example 2 (Emotional Building)

**Player A:** "Happy birthday!" 

**Player B:** "Oh, wow, thank you. I've never had a surprise birthday party before." (is mildly amused)

**Player A:** (puts a hat on **Player B** and blows a noisemaker) We've been planning this for ages!"

**Player B:** "Really? Who's 'We'?" (sees someone and eyes widen, jaw drops)

**Player A:** "That's right, it's your best friend Jerry from across the country! We flew him in!"

**Player B:** "What!?! This is so crazy!" (very amused)

**Player A:** "Yeah! But we're not done yet!" (lights sparklers and hands them to Player B)

**Player B:** "Whoa, isn't that unsafe?..."

**Player A:** "No worries, they'll understand. But check this out!" (guides a horse via its reins) "It's that pony you've been wanting since you were little!"

**Player B:** "Holy crap!" (starting to jump up and down like a child)

You see in this above example, **Player A** is clearly guiding the action. This doesn't mean that **Player B** has not been building on the information. We're getting lots of factual information from **Player A**, but we're also getting lots of emotional information from **Player B.**

**Player B** is effectively playing the Voice of Reason right now. **Player B** is the Everyperson, the stand-in for the audience member, who is reacting honestly and passionately to the stimuli. Since **Player B** has the pressure of continually getting more and more excited, it's become the goal of **Player A** to make **Player B** as crazy as possible with more and more outlandish gifts. It's up to both of them to continue building this Game that's developed between the two of them. 

The above example illustrates that we can build information in more ways than providing facts and moving the action along. Emotional reaction is just as valid of a way of developing the reality of a scene.

### When Facts and Emotions Collide

Though you can develop a scene with pure emotion, another (potentially stronger) choice is to allow that emotional energy to push your statements. If you're simply reacting with emotional honesty, you do put a lot of pressure on your scene partner to continue to develop the tangible elements of the scene. Find ways to allow your emotion to inform what you say next. If you're joyous because of the other character, what does that make you want to do? What does that make you want to say? You can stay in the present moment and do something in that scene, or you can reference the past and provide explanation as to why you feel so much joy now.

This is where that give-and-take of emotional honesty comes in. The other player made you feel something, now you can use that feeling to say something that affect the other player. Did they react? Did you want that sort of reaction, as a character? React to that. If they didn't react, react to the fact that they didn't react. 

### Example 3 (Emotional Building and More)

(scene continued from above)

**Player A:** "No worries, they'll understand. But check this out!" (guides a horse via its reins) "It's that pony you've been wanting since you were little!"

**Player B:** "Holy crap!" (starting to jump up and down like a child)

**Player A:** "Right? Don't you love it?"

**Player B:** "Yes! I love it so much! I love it so much... and I love you so much! 

**Player A:** "I love you, too, baby."

**Player B:** "I love you so much... let's get married!"

**Player A:** "Ye- what?"

**Player B:** "Let's get married! You love me, right?"

**Player A:** "Well, yeah, but-"

**Player B:** "Then let's get married... unless you don't want to..." 

**Player A:** "No! I mean, I want to, but... can we talk about this later?"

**Player B:** "Later, later, later. You keep pushing it off, I don't know if I can wait that long."

Okay, so I did something with this scene here. Rather than continuing to play the established game, I swerved to illustrate an emotionally honest tennis match. 

**Player A** was able to affect **Player B** so much that **Player B** felt like they should engage in holy matrimony. 

**Player A** was not prepared for such a reaction and thus responded with a shocked "what?" 

**Player B** assumed that **Player A** simply couldn't hear, so **Player B** repeated the statement... then noticing the shocked look afterwards, immediately gave a panicked question, "You love me, right?"

**Player A** feels as though saying a full, blunt "Yes" would be mutually inclusive of marriage, so is apprehensive in answering.

**Player B** feels the apprehension and wants to take it back with "unless you don't want to..."

**Player A** feels guilty about hurting **Player B** and wants to push it to later.

**Player B** is triggered by the move towards procrastination. **Player B** has clearly been waiting to be wed, and this moment is the last straw. They're having their confrontation now.

Allowing yourself to be affected by your scene partner gives you emotional energy to use to affect him/her/them in return. As you continue affecting each other, you build and build until you reach an inevitable climax, at which point, the scene's tension changes. 

This is an interesting scene because the players are invested in it, in themselves, and in each other. They are staying true to their emotions and allowing the emotions to continue to build and build, while developing more and more details of the relationship as they speak back-and-forth.

## EXERCISES

### Reverse Chicken

(credit to Chris Bodily)

Two players stand facing each other on opposite sides of the play area. Their focus is on each other. They will begin a scene and their lines are supposed to affect each other. If a player feels as though they have been affected by a line, they must take a step forward and continue the exercise at that distance. The exercise ends when the two reach each other or there's a suitable button.

This allows the players to practice making statements that directly affect each other. This also is an opportunity to create a one-sided emotional response, in which one player is simply saying things to affect the other, while the other is simply reacting.

### Emotions from 1 to 10

(credit to Chris Henderson)

Two players up. One player is given an emotion. Basic or complex, it's up to you. The two players begin a scene and the player who has been given an emotion begins the scene at a Level 1 of that emotion (lowest level, but not apathetic). As the scene progresses, the coach will shout the next consecutive number and the player must build his/her/their emotional state to that level, concluding at a Level 10 (maximum).

## SUMMARY

- Emotional Reactions go both ways: both players are seeking to affect each other and be affected by each other.

- Emotional Building is still building in the scene.

- Using emotions to guide your factual information allows for stronger moves.
