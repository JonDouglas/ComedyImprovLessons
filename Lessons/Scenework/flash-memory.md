# Flash Memory



## DESCRIPTION 

First off, I'd like to thank Chris Henderson for teaching me the concept of _Flash Memory_. He is an incredible teacher and improviser, and I'll be eternally grateful for his instruction.

Choosing an emotion at the beginning of a scene can seem tedious: mad, sad, happy, afraid. It seems so contrived, as though we now have to play that specific character and it'll be the same. Well, what if you had a specific experience to generate that emotion? Isn't it stronger if you're ticked off because you were left behind by your friends in the prom parking lot because they wanted some action? Isn't it stronger if you're depressed because the one girl you thought was The One decided to leave the country?

### Faster than the Speed of Light

This technique goes beyond A to B. It's a very personal maneuver in which your emotion and perspective is informed by your past. You receive a suggestion and rather than engaging in a simple connection or building a list, you recall a memory associated with that suggestion. Once you've recalled that specific memory, allow it to inform your emotion.

## EXAMPLES

###EXAMPLE 1 (Quick Flash)

Suggestion is Pineapple. 

(_Flash:_ I don't like pineapple on pizza but my mom always likes to get it. I hate Hawaiian Pizza but I defer to her because she's mom. Emotion = begrudging acceptance)

After that _Flash,_ I can use that memory to inform my perspective and emotion in the scene. I adopt a perspective indicative of Begrudging Acceptance, so my posture and actions will be affected by that (head down, trying to plow through, clear face of displeasure). Here's an example from a coaching session:

### EXAMPLE 2 (Coffee)

(Thanks to Mark Hansen)

**Matt:** "So your suggestion is Coffee. What's the first memory that the word Coffee brings to mind?"

**Mark:** "When I would go to JB's as a teenager. We would joke around with the waitress. We had so much fun then."

**Matt:** "Sounds like you went there a lot. But is there a specific instance you remember? A specific event?"

**Mark:** "Hmm... well, they had a cigarette machine."

**Matt:** "Like a vending machine?"

**Mark:** "Yeah! We were underage then, so we would wait until they weren't looking and then get one."

**Matt:** " Okay! So what kind of emotion does that spark up for you?"

**Mark:** "Rebellious and carefree."

**Matt:** "Okay, so embody that emotion. What kind of posture might you have?"

**Mark:** "I'd probably lean back, have my arm up  on the back of the booth."

**Matt:** "Now look at me and what do you see about me, from my posture?" (I'm leaning forwards, elbows on the table, fingers laced together)

**Mark:** "I'm getting a power struggle between us. Like trying to be more alpha. I'm the one who's joking around and making everyone laugh and have a good time."

**Matt:** "So I want that. You're basically the charismatic leader and I want that. We have a power struggle to see who the leader of the group is. So now that you know that information, what would you say to initiate this scene?"

**Mark:** "I think you're wrong. I think that waitress is hot. You need to stop worrying all the time and just live life."

This example gives us a bit more than just _Flash Memory_ (listening, assessing your scene partner, etc), but let's focus on the _Flash Memory_ bit. He was able to use that memory from his past, the one he pulled directly off of the suggestion of Coffee, and he immediately established the relationship between the two of us. He painted me as the worrying character and himself as the carefree character. The bold statements, "I think you're wrong. I think that waitress is hot" imply that my character said that the waitress isn't hot before the scene began. Why would I say that? It might've been a power play because Mark's character got her number and my character wanted to undercut his skill and thus his standing in the group.

The key in _Flash Memory_ that separates it from A to B and even A to C is that the memory is personal and significant. If you flash and remember going to a restaurant as a child, try to remember one specific big instance. The time you dropped your glass on the table. The time there was a fight in the parking lot. The time the waiter gave up and didn't get you your food on time. When the memory is significant, you can easily find an emotion to pull from it. 

### EXAMPLE 3 (Flashing off Initiations)

You can also _Flash_ off an initiation. Let's say that you didn't get to begin the scene with a suggestion and your partner says a line before you do. Let's give that a try.

**Player A:** "Yo, you're in the wrong part of town."

(**Player B** _Flash:_ I remember watching Don't Be a Menace with my cousin and just cracking up because of how the main character had a nuke in his truck in his oneupmanship against the gang members. Emotion: Amusement and confidence)

**Player B:** "Hahaha, nice try, buddy."

You see how much stronger this is than simply picking an emotion? This technique gives you the opportunity to draw from your life and find an informed emotion, so you have supporting evidence to drive it forward.

As with any skill (geez, never thought I'd be writing that!), you need to work on this to get in the habit of it and to develop speed. With time, you'll get to the point where you can _Flash Memory_ off a suggestion/initiation in an instant, and even _Flash Memory_ in response to regular lines in a scene so you can enhance your in-scene reactions.

## EXERCISES 

### Give Me Your Flash Drive

Have one player sit in a chair facing the class. That player is given a suggestion and is told to Flash Memory. Then the player explains the memory that was recalled. The player must then explain what sort of emotion and perspective he/she/they would adopt as a result of this.

Then do it again with initiating lines.

### You Flash Me I Flash You

Two players get up for a scene. One player is given a suggestion and is told to Flash Memory it. That player then gives an initiation based on the Flash Memory. The responding player then Flashes based on that initiation and gives a response based on that Flash. The players then engage in a scene.

## SUMMARY

- It's deeper, more personal than A to B and A to C.

- Recall a memory based on the suggestion or initiation and use it to inform your emotion and perspective. 

- Specific, Significant, and Personal.
