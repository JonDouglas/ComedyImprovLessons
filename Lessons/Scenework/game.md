# Game

## DESCRIPTION

### Introduction

_Game_ is one of the most integral and yet misunderstood facets of improv. People play _Game_ without realizing it because they simply weren't taught it. Particularly in short form, classes don't focus on _Game,_ so scenes tend to become very erratic and unfocused. We're going to go through _Game_ once and for all.

### Don't Hate the Playa

It took me ages to figure out what _Game_ is, because I wasn't focused enough on the concept. Frankly speaking, it's the tension/dynamic of the scene. That doesn't say much, does it? Think of it in terms of Wants/Desires and relate it to our goals in improv: if I (the character) want it, it's up to you to not allow me to have it. There's a game right there. If there's a series of puns being made because the suggestion was Prince and everyone decided to make Prince references (Purple Rain and the like), that's the game. _Game_ is simply a repeated pattern based on the existing information.

If you began in short form, you can relate it back to Short Form Games. Every Short Form _Game_ follows a specific pattern. _Game_ in a scene is figuring out something you can repeat, but this is created organically rather than going from established rules. Short Form _Games_ consist of players who have agreed upon a specific dynamic beforehand, and then playing that dynamic.

Caruso: Puns of death involving a specific profession/location.

Pick-up Lines: Puns and Double Entendre involving love/romance/dating/sex and a specific profession/location.

Murder Mystery: Pantomime and Gibberish with difficult subjects.

Understudy: Big assumptions leading to wild differences while the remaining player struggles to maintain order.

Revolver is the quintessential _Game_ game in Short Form. For the Long Formers, you can think of Revolver as a fast-paced Harold with 4 scenes. Of course, it doesn't have to be played with _Game,_ but the best Revolvers I've seen and been a part of have involved _Game._ Generally, a jump in time to a different location with a specific _Game_ element remaining constant is enough for the next beats. I was never taught _Game_ when I learned Revolver, so I didn't really understand how to play it properly until I received more Long Form training and made the connection.

## EXAMPLES

### EXAMPLE 1. (Silent Scene)

(**Player A** juggles one ball) 

(**Player B** juggles two balls) 

(**Player A** juggles three balls)

_Game:_ One-upsmanship (Anything you can do, I can do better)

### EXAMPLE 2 (Club Scene)

**Player A:** "Come on, three people just left!"

**Player B:** "Nope, I can't let you in."

_Game:_ Want/Deny (You want something, I won't allow you to have it)

### EXAMPLE 3 (Suggestion: Harry Potter)

**Player A:** "Now, Harry, it's time for you to take your college entrance exams. First section is the easiest: Basic Arithmetic.

**Player B:** "Arithmetic? What's that?"

_Game:_ Wizards don't learn the same things Muggles do (Put Harry in the real world and introduce him to all the things that are different)

The key here is recognizing the _game._ The players make an unspoken agreement to play a specific _game_ when they make each respective move in that direction. Once the _game_ is revealed, both players continue to elevate the game, playing it with bigger and bigger moves. 

It's fairly obvious how to make the 1. Silent Scene bigger (and it's already been done there), but how do you play and heighten a _game_ like 2. Club Scene? Do you continue to have Player A try to get to places and Player B is there to deny her? You could, but that feels like we're jumping the gun. I would try something like this:

### EXAMPLE 4 (Heightening the Club Scene)

**Player A:** "Come on, three people just left!"

**Player B:** "Nope, I can't let you in."

**Player A:** "Please, I need to get in there. Apollo Smith is playing and I love his music."

**Player B:** "You and everyone else in this city! Nope, if I let you in now, I would lose my job. I love my job."

Both players are playing the _Game._ Player A heightened her point-of-view by saying that she loves Apollo Smith's music. Player B lessened the severity of her point-of-view by saying that "everyone else in this city" loves Apollo Smith's music and heightened his own point-of-view by saying that he would lose a job that he loves if he let her in. All the players need to do is keep elevating their points-of-view in opposition to each other and they're playing the game of this scene. Eventually, someone will lose. I usually prefer the person who has the higher position (the bouncer [**Player B**] in this case) to concede in some way ("Whoops, I read the wrong list and you're actually on the correct one"), but the payoff for the winner should be horrible ("What!?! It's over already!?!"). So both players lose. 

In this case, we can return to this game in another beat where **Player A** is about to go into a plane and **Player B** won't let her through. Logical progression, but because we've played this game enough, it might be enough of a button for **Player A** to be walking with her new hubby to a gate and **Player B** suddenly appears in front of said gate. **Player A** exclaims something in frustration, the audience realizes that they're in the same situation, and the lights cut out. If the first scene was short (resulting in this second beat being less of an immediate button but yielding a little more scene time), we might be able to revisit the game in a third beat with something outrageous like **Player A** trying to go into Heaven through the Pearly Gates and Saint Peter is about to let her in... but is replaced by **Player B** as Saint Peter goes on a smoke break.

As you can see, playing game requires moves from both players in the scene. If **Player B** simply allowed her in, then the tension is gone, that _game_ is over and they must discover a different _game_ in the club, I suppose.

The Harry Potter scene has the most interesting _game_ but it requires the most effort: both players must know about things that the Wizarding world would and would not teach, and both players must be ready to play with each of those elements. In order to keep the audience guessing, the moves need to be clever. The setup has already been done, so we just need to find different scenarios to deliver punchlines in this _Game._ To bring it back home, since we have the premise, it's basically now a Line Game with Scene in between, in which each player works to deliver more "Why Wouldn't Harry Potter Survive in the Real World" jokes.

### Final Thoughts on Heightening

The concept of heightening is virtually automatic. When you recognize a game, you make moves to make your point-of-view in the _game_ bigger. How do you do this? Sometimes it's just a matter of making the logical jump upwards. The move from the club to an airport gate to the Pearly Gates would be an example of heightening logically. 

But what about ambiguous moves? Or what if a player makes a move that's a logical step backwards? How do we deal with that?

SUPPORT IT. If a move is not clearly bigger than the last, it's up to the person receiving the information to make it bigger than the last. This is simply done by reacting more significantly in response to the latest move. If the pattern is something like:

1. Here's a library card.

2. Here's a baby.

3. Here's a degree.

Generally the baby would be placed on a higher level than the degree, so it's up to the recipient of the three things to react more crazily to the degree so the audience understands that it's more significant. You may need to figure out a way to justify this, but this is a clear way to help your teammates.

## SUMMARY

- Game is the tension/dynamic/pattern established based on existing information.

- Game is created when both players agree to play it.

- Game in scenes is similar to Short Form Games, it's just a matter of figuring it out.

- SUPPORT every move. Even if it's not logically bigger, you react as though it is and figure out why.
