# Not Fixing the Bike

## DESCRIPTION

### Introduction

Frequently, the concept of _Yes, And_ is applied as a One-Size-Fits-All pair of gloves. This umbrella usage of the literal phrase results in a lot of scenes of activity that do not delve into the relationship, the characters themselves, nor any other deeper element in the scene outside of the activity. Frankly, the desire to accomplish something results in scenes that focus on the results of the characters in improv, rather than the process of improvisation. Audiences are there to see the process.

### Pantomime and _Not Fixing the Bike_

Our goal in improv is not to fix the issue. It's about making the most interesting choice. Generally speaking, fixing the thing is not the most interesting choice, but the interesting move is rather the exploration of the process of fixing the thing, or the relationships around the activity.

This is a relevant way of looking at blocking because we can apply it to any scenario to figure out whether the move was good for the scene or not. We fix the bike immediately. Now what? What was interesting about that? People fix bikes all the time. I don't want to watch someone actually fix a bike on stage, especially if the entire scene is about two people talking about fixing it as they're fixing it.

What about exploring a relationship while fixing a bike? There's a reason that gossip (celebrity news, anyone) is so interesting to people in general while technical information is a niche topic (a presentation about fixing the engine of a muscle car). When we watch a scene, it's as though we're spying on the juicy lives of others, without having to hear it all secondhand. Don't make the scene technical by focusing on the bike. It's all about the people and how they relate to each other and the world. 

So how do we make a scene with a bike fixing interesting? Work on fixing the bike, but talk about something else. Discuss one's place in the world, explore how the two characters feel about each other. Fixing the bike can happen while they're talking about something more interesting. Fixing the bike can happen while they're engaged in a struggle deeper than the bike itself. Of course, every now and then one person might ask the other to hold the bike still while the first person affixes some piece of the bike, but the crux of the conversation is between them and how they relate to each other and the world.

### Making the Problem Worse

The desire to solve problems quickly and efficiently is a general affliction of the human condition. The tension and the desire to release that tension compels us to act. This fact is used extensively in entertainment and is easily illustrated in Horror movies.

A character hears a sound in the distance. She decides to check it out. It's dark and the hallway light won't turn on. The sound effects/music in the background continuously builds as she investigates. The camera work reduces the peripheral vision. She slowly moves into the darkness, the sense of impending doom building and building. She wanders into the basement and the door shuts behind her. She tries to leave but it won't budge. The fear builds and builds until she turns back towards the basement and something jumps out as the music crescendos.

This is used in basically every movie, but I believe it's easiest to understand in Horror movies because of how many times it'll occur in a short time frame. The problem is created with the sound in the distance. The character goes to investigate. Tension continues to build because of all the problems that worsen the situation (dark, lights won't turn on, peripheral vision is impaired, basement is a dead end and, superstitiously, the room of fear, the door closes and cuts off the path of escape).

This concept may be applied to all of our improvised scenes. A problem is created or a tension arises and the players continually work to make it a bigger deal with every move. 

## EXAMPLES

### Example 1 (Making the Problem worse)

**Player A:** "I'm super nervous about this."

**Player B:** "No worries! It's just a dance. What's the worst that could happen?"

**Player A:** "She could say no!"

**Player B:** "That's it! That's all. It's not like she'd tell everyone about it, right?"

**Player A:** "She's the biggest gossip in the school!"

**Player B:** "I'm sure it'll be fine. You've got a good relationship with her, right?"

**Player A:** "Well... yeah. We sit together all the time when we go to the Computer Lab."

**Player B:** "Yeah! You're a lock. You're just riding the momentum, now. All those positive emotions of you sitting by her during Computer Lab in first period... those will help buoy you to victory!"

**Player A:** "Oh no..."

**Player B:** "... What?"

**Player A:** "Well, you said that I would ride those positive emotions... I actually got into an argument with her during Computer Lab."

**Player B:** "What!? Why!?!"

**Player A:** "Well, I thought the paper should be typed in Helvetica and she preferred Verdana and we got into a big spat."

**Player B:** "Oh, it's okay, it's okay! I mean, you just need to apologize and then ask, right? You've got time, it's not like someone else is prepping some big plan to ask her, right?:

**Player A:** "Oh crap..."

The game here is that **Player B,** in the course of trying to make **Player A** feel better about asking a girl to the dance, is bringing up more and more discouraging things to make **Player A** feel worse. **Player B** is actually just laying the groundwork for **Player A** to fill in the blanks of what's happened. **Player B** sets it up and **Player A** brings it home with the specifics of the girl, his recent interactions with her, and other circumstances that make him more and more likely to be rejected.

The players have worked together to build the tension in this scene. We see that **Player A** is continually becoming more and more anxious about being rejected and **Player B** is continually helping **Player A** to become more anxious. The problem is becoming worse. The characters want to fix the problem. The actors want to make it worse. As such, the characters will continue to make it worse by attempting to fix the problem.

## EXERCISES

### Don't Focus on Your Hand While You're Dribbling

(credit to Calvin Dittmore, Chris Bodily, and Chelsea Maki)

Ask for an activity suggestion that can be applied on stage. Two players take to the stage and engage in that activity but they cannot talk about the activity. They simply must occupy the space, pantomiming to show off the world, and focus on their relationship.

This exercise provides an opportunity for players to work on their ability to provide information through pantomime without making the entire scene about the activity.

### Making It Worse

Circle up! Receive a suggestion for an issue or a conflict that people would worry about (presentation at school, late for work, etc) and List Build together a series of ways to make that situation worse. The goal is to build progressively, so that each step makes it worse and worse and worse until it couldn't possibly get much worse.

Example:

Suggestion: Printer is out of paper

1: Our storeroom is in the basement.

2: There's a creepy security guard that's into you and always drags you into conversation when you go by his desk.

3: When it's late at night, as it is now, he goes to his office. His office is in the basement.

4: The elevator is broken.

5: The stairs have inconsistent lighting; some lights are on, some are off, some flicker.

6: You've heard odd noises taking the stairs in the past, but haven't worried too much about it because those trips were in the day time.

## SUMMARY

- Audiences want to see the process of improv.

- Explore deeper subjects than what your characters are doing in the scene. Talking a little bit about the activity is all right, but focus on how that activity helps to inform the relationship between the two characters and what makes this moment significant.

- Building tension together is a delight to watch. The characters may want to fix the problem while the actors behind those characters do not.
