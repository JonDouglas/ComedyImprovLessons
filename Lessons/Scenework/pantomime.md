# Pantomime

I would like to credit and acknowledge Hal Peller, Chris Henderson, Calvin Dittmore, Chris Bodily, and Chelsea Maki.

## DESCRIPTION

### Introduction

Many improvisers stress the need to express the Who, What, Where, etc. as soon as possible in a scene. Pantomime can help you with so many of those elements, so you don't have to frontload everything onto your first sentence. Many improvisers fear the Talking Heads scene. Many improvisers fear running out of things to say. Pantomime can help with all those issues.

### In Action

I sound like an infomercial. But it's true, pantomime can do so many things. If I walk into a scene and say, "Hey, we're at the supermarket," it would sound completely contrived. But if I walk in pushing a cart, start feeling and banging the fruits, pull a plastic bag from the holder, put 3 apples in a bag and put it in my cart, you know that we're in some sort of grocery store/fruit market without a word. I can focus on the other information (namely, my scene partner) and develop the scene at the same time. 

I can be discussing my problems at work while I do all of that pantomime, just like a couple might talk about their day while grocery shopping. If I just started talking about work and we stood there, we'd be talking heads. But the pantomime gives a certain momentum, an activity that serves the purpose of adding realism and informing the scene. 

### Filling the Silence

The pantomime can help you fill the silence in a more natural manner. It's normal to pause because you need to rip apart two plastic bags with your teeth. It's normal to react to your scene partner using a strange tactic for picking cantaloupe. You can use the time needed with these activities to ground yourself in the scene. Consider everything that's been established, consider a game that may or may not have formed. A pause while you're doing something feels more normal and comfortable than a pause while you're just talking to your scene partner. 

### Pantomime to Inform Your Scenework

Pantomime is frequently treated as a side attraction to the words, the emotions, and the gimmicks of improv. This shouldn't be the case. Pantomime does so much to enrich a scene, even revealing key traits and information to help inform your scene as you go along. The way you grab your keys, the way you close the fridge, the way you open a door, these are all pantomime moves that can and should affect the character, the scene, and the situation.

### Pantomime Consistency

Pantomime establishes a reality that must be respected. When we walk onto the stage as improvisers, we enter into a covenant with the audience. They are willing to believe that we are not ourselves, that we are wearing spacesuits, that we have lasers and space shuttles on stage, overall that imaginary things are real. They are willing to believe this, as long as we maintain this as reality.

Breaking this reality is easy. Eating food on a plate on a table and then someone stepping through it will break this covenant if you don't react accordingly ("What the hell, Hulk?! I was eating on that!"). Grabbing a shovel, forgetting about it, then grabbing it again from thin air, will break this covenant. Recognize the space you're in, recognize the objects you're playing with, and make sure they're maintained.

## EXERCISES

### Just Do It

Exercise done in day-to-day life

Think carefully every time you do anything. 

Key areas common to improv:

*Cars:* 

How does your body move when you step into your car? 

How quickly do you buckle your seat belt, turn the key in the ignition, adjust the rear view mirror and seats? 

When you grip your steering wheel, think about where you put your hands, how your fingers feel when you shift to reverse, how you turn your head and look to see if there's any traffic or pedestrians as you back up. 

How do your eyes navigate the area in front of your vehicle as you move forward? 

How do you watch for potential areas of conflict. How do you move when you leave the vehicle?

**Doors:**

How do you fingers pull the keys out of your pocket and guide each key into the hole? What sort of resistance is there when you turn the key? Which direction do the keys turn?

Do you watch the knob after the door's been unlocked?

How heavy is the door? Does it swing easily? Is there a creak to it?

Do you need to close the door after you walk through? Do you need to lock it?

**Dining:**

How do you sit down at the table? Do you need to pull the chair in after you're seated?

Do you place a tablecloth on your lap?

Do you hold the menu with just your hands or do you prefer to lean it on the table? Maybe you open it and set it on the table? If so, do you allow it on the plate that's already there? Is there a plate already there, or do they come out when the food arrives?

Do you set up your utensils before you eat? 

Do you hold your fork and knife the entire time? Do you cut everything up before you start eating? Do you use only the fork, preferring to cut things with your fork unless a knife is absolutely necessary?

How do you talk when you're eating? Do you set your utensils down? Do you cover your mouth so you can talk without showing the food in there?

How does your mouth move as you're chewing?

How does your throat move as you're swallowing?

How do you go about getting a drink from your glass?

How do you sit as you become full?

Where do you put your utensils as you finish?

How do you pay? Do you use their pen or do you have your own? Do you look at the receipt first or just hand them your credit card?

**Handling a Gun:**

How big and long is the gun? How heavy is it?

Where are your fingers? (special caveat: in a safe situation, normally people don't hold their index finger on the trigger because of safety concerns, but do so in an improv scene because otherwise people will think you're pantomiming it incorrect [because putting your finger to the side of the gun looks like you're making a hand gun]).

How do you load the gun?

Is the safety on?

Are there bullets in the gun?

Do you need to cock it?

Is there a strap to it?

Do you need to rest it in the crook of your arm?

What's the recoil like?

Is your body physically reacting when you fire (recoil in arms, blinking of eyes, flinching of head)? Why or why not?

Do you need to reload in between shots?

**Operating a Cellular Phone:**

How big is it? 

Is it in your pocket, a bag, or a holster?

Is it a smart phone with a touch screen?

Do you need to unlock it before you can access it?

What menus do you need to navigate before you can make a call?

How do you hold the phone up to your ear?

How long does it take to connect, on average?

Do you greet people differently on the phone as opposed to in person?

What do you do with your hands and eyes while you're talking on the phone?

How long are the pauses between you talking and the other person talking?

Do you have special verbal nuances on the phone when you're saying good-bye? (I hear a lot of mmm-byes when I'm on the phone, as though they need the bye to be punctuated by something)

How do you hang up?

Do you check your phone for notifications before you return it to your pocket?

As you can see, there's a certain amount of neurosis that comes into writing these exerciseses (don't worry, I own it). But that's a small portion of what goes through my head when I do those things with the intent to improve my pantomime.

### Analysis Paralysis

Coach/Class Exercise

Simply ask a student to engage in a pantomime of a common activity. Pause them whenever they make a choice incorrect or inconsistent with the reality established (steering wheel changed position inexplicably, stopped car but didn't use the brake, dropped an object), and correct it immediately.

You may also run this with a camera, so one can see exactly where one went wrong. 

## Summary

- Actions speak a thousand words. Pantomime can inform your scene through providing environment, relationship, activity, and logical openings for silence.

- Pantomime can illustrate your mood, your feelings towards someone in that moment, how you approach life as that character.

- You can work on Pantomime during the entire day by simply being aware of how your body and hands operate in specific activities.
