# Starting a Scene

## Description

### Introduction

"I need two up. Your suggestion is Pineapple." Pineapple... What do I do?! The nature of Improv lies in being able to do anything and anytime, anywhere, but how do you begin? What separates strong initiations from weak ones?

### Degree of Information Conveyed and How Much Is Needed?

This is it. I've been thinking about a way to determine how strong an initiation is and there are so many ways to go about it. The strongest way I could think of is:

**How Much Information Does This Initiation Convey?**

and

**How Much Information Is Needed?**

If those two match up, you have a strong initiation. If those two do not, then you may still have a strong initiation in a vacuum, but it's not the best suited for the show and therefore not strong.

With this ruler in hand, let's take a look at the common mistake in initiations!

### Putting the Pressure on Your Scene Partner

Note that I didn't call out questions! I'm calling out the practice of putting the burden of the scene on your scene partner. Not giving it to them, allowing them to work with it and then taking it when you need to, but rather forcing the burden of the success of the scene onto them.

I'm going to start addressing this through the Subtext. The Subtext is key in communication and the grave error that is committed lies in providing zero information through body language, tone, proximity, facial expression, etc. The player who simply looks at you, stands there (cheated out, of course!) 1/3 of the way across the stage away from you, and is standing as himself/herself/themselves as though you have been the blessed opportunity to start the scene, but you've actually been forced to do it entirely. Oh, by the way, they actually said the first line in the scene. But it means nothing because there's nothing in it. They could have said something profound, but the fact that there's no physical information being given, you might have dismissed it entirely. The face, the body, the distance, the tone, the emotion, it's all blank. They might have said, "I love you," with that tone and it would mean so little, because it's clear that it means little to the player. Your body transmits information, don't allow it to put the pressure of the scene on your scene partner.

In the above scenario, with the setup we established, it's pretty clear that the player knows the basic hard-and-fast stage rules (cheated out!), but they may be stuck in their head of trying to be funny. They forget that they need to be honest to the moment. They may even have ALL the rules in their head and may state a line that establishes everything that we want in an initiation.

"Mom, we can't live in the dump anymore."

That transmitted a lot of information, but if everyone is in polite "this is how everyone in improv is supposed to stand" mode, and the player is in "let's make sure the line follows the rules but I have no emotional investment in it" mode, then it's not going to have the same amount of impact. The information is there, but how should it be interpreted when 60 - 90 % of the communication (the statistic of nonverbal communication seems to be misquoted every time I hear it, so I'm giving the range) is blocked off by one's overthinking of the situation?

### How to Gauge the Information Needed

To determine how much information you need to convey in your initiation, calculate the amount of stage time you'll have to explore that specific scene. 

If you're in a show with a lot of people, you'll have less time and thus need to get more information out. If you're in a Short Form set (which typically run really quickly through each game and scene!), you'll have less time as well and need to get more information out.

If you're in a Long Form show with very few people and lots of time, it's very likely that you'll have the opportunity to carefully expand and explore those ideas so you can use less information in your initiations, in favor of realism. Of course, not all small Long Forms run slowly, so keep that in mind before you initiate a scene with a bunch of subtext and a scoff.

### How to Create that Strong Initiation

We already addressed the issue of Text and Subtext above. The way to do it properly is to treat your initiation with the respect that it deserves. If you're going to drop a bombshell like, "Honey, I'm leaving and I'm taking the kids," then you need to feel that in your bones and allow that to inform your body. I imagine that I'd be trying to be strong, but a part of me is shaking, quivering because I'm afraid of what he's going to do. I know that I need to stay strong or else he's going to be nice again and convince me to stay. I need to look him in the eye so he sees that I'm being serious and won't be swayed. My voice has deepened to make sure it's strong, but I've overcorrected a little bit and it's a little too harsh.

The line itself shows everything we need as an audience. I'm clearly in a romantic relationship involving kids with the other player. The subtext fills in the rest. But, of course, his reaction will solidify or change the nature of our relationship in fact. Whether the established reality changes or not, I will maintain my subtext because that's how it means to me, as the character.

You can either start with the subtext or start with the text. Either way, you're simply deciding on the second step and then the third. The first step is to look at your scene partner to determine your relationship. Look at your position, look at how your scene partner is looking at you, look at how your scene partner feels about you and the circumstances, then choose.

If you choose to start in the subtext, then you're choosing your emotion, your internal struggle, the way you walk and speak, the nonverbals that will be carried by to your scene partner in whatever line you find fits the situation.

If you choose to start in the text, then you're choosing to establish details of the scene first (relationship clarification, location, circumstances). This line of dialog will then be colored by the internal subtext you choose to impart onto it.

Let's move into the text. I like starting with subtext because certain lines that are purported to be horrible initiations can become great initiations based on the formula above and the amount of subtext given. "What are you doing?" without subtext is considered a horrible initiation, particularly in fast-paced show where information is needed quickly. But let's take a look at a subtext-filled version.

## EXAMPLES

### Example 1 (Questions are Okay!)

(**Player A** grabs a cell phone and calls someone)

(**Player B** sees this and steps into the scene to pick up her phone)

**Player B:** "Hello?"

**Player A:** (smiles and says seductively) "What are you doing?"

The same question is transformed into a big initiation that reveals a lot about the relationship between **Player A** and **Player B,** in a very realistic manner. The subtext is key. 

### Example 2 (Another one!?)

(**Player A** paces across the stage. He looks at his watch. Paces back across the stage. His face is visibly agitated)

(**Player B** walks in and stops)

**Player A:** (eyes widen, as if **Player B** should not be there at all, says angrily) "What are you doing?" 

Again, the nonverbal gave **Player B** an enormous amount of information here. Recognizing that your words comprise only a fraction of the picture is key to delivering a strong initiation. Providing subtext as well as a juicy line allows you to relieve the pressure on your partner in the scene.

## SUMMARY

- Degree of Information Conveyed vs Degree of Information Needed = Strength of Initiation

- Subtext conveys information, too. Use it to strengthen your initiating words.

- Less Time to Explore and Expand the Scene = More Information Needed in Initiation.

- More Time to Explore and Expand the Scene = Less Information Needed in Initiation.

- Feel the line in your very soul. Allow it to inform your subtext so your verbal and nonverbal communication become one.

- Feel your subtext in your bones. Allow it to inform your text so your nonverbal and verbal communication become one.

- The FIRST STEP: Your Scene Partner shows you exactly what you need to say and how you need to say it.
