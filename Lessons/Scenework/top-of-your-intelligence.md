# Top of Your Intelligence

## DESCRIPTION

### Introduction

Dumb characters are funny, right? Jim Carrey in Dumb and Dumber, Mr. Bean in Mr. Bean, the list goes on. However, the key element here is that the writers recognize the circumstances in which the stupidity can be funny. This requires intellect. Stupidity on its own does nothing. Stupidity in a specific way in a specific circumstance, is hilarious. Written material has the advantage of being able to set up all the variables for stupid to be funny. But how does this work in improv?

### Playing Dumb is not Playing Dumbly

Before we get into this, when I say "Dumb" I mean a character that is ignorant of a specific topic. So a character who shows up at the gym and has no idea of proper form, gym etiquette, etc. would be a Dumb character.

To be a good stage partner, you bring all of your knowledge, all of your experiences onto the stage. The Dumb character may be Dumb, but the actor is still bringing forth all of that information to inform that character. 

The classic trap that people fall into is playing a Dumb character that doesn't know how to do anything and always does things improperly. It might get a chuckle the first time, but continually watching someone's incompetence at a base level gets old fast.

Playing Dumb requires skill and intellect about the subject at hand. It's a sort of willful "ignorance is bliss" and suspended disbelief state of being, for you and the audience. This is sort of the mindset involved with Professional Wrestling Entertainment (WWE style). The audience knows that you're knowledgeable about the topic, but they're willing to accept that your character is not. This acceptance is very much like the acceptance involved in pantomime, where they're willing to believe that there's a table where you say there is one, until you destroy the reality by walking through it. This covenant between you and your audience is what makes playing a Dumb character work. The audience expects you to play it well, to set yourself up (and your teammates should be setting you up, too) for Dumb payoffs that they didn't see coming. 

### Playing Children

A lot of people play Children as Dumb Characters. I'm not sure why they'd do this, because playing Children already limits you significantly. A lot of subject matter that'd be fine, normally, would be a no-no if your scene partner is playing a child. So why throw on another flat tire?

I like to play Children that are hyper intelligent. Or, at least, as intelligent as I am. And willfully ignorant towards certain things that children wouldn't be aware of (but can break the fourth wall to address something like that).

### References to Things you Love

A lot of people are afraid of looking too intelligent in day-to-day conversation. Perhaps this hearkens back to the days of grade school, where smart people were seen as outsiders. In order to fit in, people would suppress their intellectual abilities. Instead of discussing and engaging in the works they love, they would simply go with the crowd and quote humor that everyone else liked.

If you can relate to that on any level, please realize that you're in a safe space on stage. You can reveal the facets of your life (audience-appropriate, don't ever forget) that you love and the audience will go with you on that ride. Who knows, you may even ring true with a kindred spirit or two in the audience.

The point is that you never dumb down your humor for the sake of the audience. You bring everything you have in your knowledge banks to the stage. If you have a Schrödinger's Cat reference that is perfect in this scene, say it! The audience may get it, they may not. It doesn't matter. You have the tool, use it. You're on stage, use everything you have at your disposal.

My favorite laughs came about when I referenced some obscure film that most people probably hadn't seen (hipster moment). I got a couple chuckles from the audience but there was one person in the back who was going CRAZY for it. So what did I do? I kept running down that path, going obscurer and obscurer into the work. The rest of the audience didn't quite get it, but I felt the joy from that singular presence in the back who knew exactly what I was talking about. It's a much deeper connection than I ever got from any of the base level jokes that hit with everyone.

### Pantomime

The best pantomime comes from people who've engaged in that activity before. To see someone who's operated a crane, a forklift, or other complex machinery of some sort, show off that pantomime is one of my favorite things. If there's an activity that you're exceptionally good at, and it comes up on stage, take your time and hit all those specifics. 

You can clearly see the difference between a layperson and an experienced professional. You can even create a game between you and a layperson if they happened to mess up a critical component of the activity (the audience saw it, if you ignore it intentionally then you miss out on an opportunity for gold, not to mention calling into question your own credibility as an expert). One of my favorite situations is when my scene partner decides to be an expert in a field that I'm actually very practiced in (moreso than my scene partner), so that we can play the relationship of a prodigy that immediately surpasses the mentor.

## EXAMPLES

### Example 1 (INCOMPETENT CHARACTER)

**Player A:** "Hand me the wrench."

**Player B:** (hands an object to **Player A**)

**Player A:** "That's not a wrench, that's a screwdriver. Hand me a wrench!"

**Player B:** (hands an object to **Player A**)

**Player A:** "That's not a wrench, that's a-..."

Note that the above example is a horrible scene in more ways than having a Dumb character. **Player B** didn't even decide to be a Dumb character. **Player A** turned **Player B** into a Dumb character and insisted on **Player B** continue to be Dumb when, in spite of the clear misunderstanding of the definition of a wrench, **Player A** continues to order **Player B** to grab a wrench. Maybe **Player B** isn't the Dumb character...

### EXAMPLE 2 (PLAYING A CHILD)

**Me (child):** "I wonder what my mom's doing."

**Adult**: "Well, she's with her boyfriend, so they're probably getting it on."

**Me (child):** "What do you mean?"

**Adult:** "OH! I mean, they're probably cooking!"

**Me (child):** "Oohhh, okay. I thought you were talking about something _inappropriate_ for someone my age."

In the above example, you can see that I'm breaking the fourth wall for the sake of the audience. They knew that my scene partner was referring to sex. If I were playing the child completely honestly, I wouldn't have said that final line. But I was playing it to the top of my intelligence and it hit a big button.

### EXAMPLE 3 (PLAYING A CHILD)

**Jon:** "You don't want to cut that wire or you'll get electrocuted."

**Me:** "How do I know you're not lying to me, huh? Like you lied about Santa Claus."

**Jon:** "Son, you don't want to get hurt, do you?"

**Me:** "You say that, but you said that about Santa, and he wasn't real! You took off the beard, Dad. How can I trust you about getting shocked if I can't even trust you about Santa Claus! I need evidence!"

**Jon:** "Electricity is real! You're going to get shocked if you cut through the wire! Santa Claus isn't real, the Easter Bunny isn't real-"

**Me:** "What!?" *shocked and started tearing up*

In the above example, you see that I'm playing a child who's ignorant of electricity and wiring. However, I'm not just a kid who's going to say, "Okay" and allow my scene partner to dictate the terms of the engagement. I decided to play to the top of my intelligence and delve into the history between father and son. A child who was betrayed so thoroughly by his father as to learn about Santa Claus at an early age wouldn't forget it. He would lord this emotional scar over his father every chance he had. So he became more scientifically minded, wanting evidence and disputing his father's claims. The father becomes agitated and lets slip the Easter Bunny tidbit, which is another shock to the child's psyche. I stayed true to the willful ignorance of the child character who just learned that another of his beloved characters is fictional, which ended the scene on a button in a big moment of the child's life.

Playing children who are as smart as you, while recognizing traits common to children (ignorance of sex, ignorance of certain characters, ignorance of the difficult and grueling nature of life and work, cooties, the ability to parrot the gossip of adults without tact), is the far more interesting way to tackle it than to play Dumb children.

## Summary

- Dumb requires skill and intellect

- Children are as smart as you.

- Tell me about that reference you love. You never know if someone else does, too!

- Show us professional pantomime.
