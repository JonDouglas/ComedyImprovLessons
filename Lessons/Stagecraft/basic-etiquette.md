# Basic Etiquette

## DESCRIPTION

### Introduction

As new improvisers, we are encouraged to do and be and try everything! That's okay on stage, generally, but there are certain things that we should be aware of with regards to our scene partners and the audience.

### Don't Pimp Weaknesses

Sure, you want to work on your weaknesses, right? Sure, you'd think everyone would want to work on them, right? Presumably so, but NEVER do this in a show. Your scene partners will hate you for making them do physical stuff that they can't do. Your scene partners will hate you for making them sing when they feel insecure about singing. Your scene partners will hate you for making them use an accent that they don't know how to create.

Of course, there are players who have learned to work with these weaknesses in a crowd-pleasing manner, but the safe choice is simply to take the path in which you make your scene partners look good. That's the goal, right?

### Don't Force Physical Moves

I've seen this happen. This has happened to me personally. Someone wants to make something happen and show off his strength, so he just goes and picks up another player. This is okay if it's precedented and your players are cool with it. But generally speaking, there are certain boundaries that should be established and that should not be crossed. Physical boundaries are big ones. Whether it be picking someone up (endangering them from a fall, or even just the act of picking them up [you don't know what physical ailments they have, you might exacerbate a condition]) or touching someone inappropriately, these are moves that should be carefully done. Generally, I will whisper to a player I don't know if I plan on making a move like that, so we're all happy and on the same page. If that's impossible and there's a brilliant move you want to do... err on the side of caution and make sure to talk with them about it afterwards so there's no hurt feelings.

One slap can change your entire place in the improv world.

### Don't Rely on Stereotypes

I've heard most of the stereotypes. I've played with many troupes as a guest and it seems that the immediate response is, "Hey, we've never had an Asian on our stage before! Let's make fun of Asians tonight!" I can appreciate a clever racial joke, but please don't rely on the classic stereotypes. I've heard them all, the audience has heard them all, so using them will only illicit cheap laughs.

### The Audience is Wonderful

They aren't the sharks looking to make your show uncomfortable. Sure, some people will shout out bad/raunchy/common suggestions for you, but they're there to enjoy your show. They paid to enjoy your show. They want you to succeed. They want you to make them laugh. They want you to show them something interesting.

If you involve the audience, make sure you pay them the proper respect. You're on stage because you want to be and you've worked for it. Pulling an audience member on stage is nerve wracking for them because all that internal fear exists without the practice that improvisers have had (usually). Introduce yourself. Shake their hand. Thank them for helping out. Don't make fun of them in a mean way.

If you treat the audience as though they were your fellow players, you'll have plenty of people clamoring to be a part of the magic.

### Giving and Taking Notes

If someone is in a show with you and you have basic notes for them, don't give them unsolicited. If someone asks, think about your delivery. Unsolicited notes are like unsolicited advice: unwanted, annoying, unheard. People are usually their own worst critics, so giving notes about someone's performance will simply be adding fuel to their analytical fire.

Of course, if you feel like someone on your team hurt you or threw you under the bus in a show, you can engage in a conversation about that, because that involves you personally, and communication among a troupe is key. 

If you're down in the dumps about a bad show and everyone else is riding high, don't ask them for advice at that moment. You're in a bad state of mind. It will feel as though you're fishing for compliments. No one wants to deal with that. I don't think you'd even be able to take any criticisms, if you're anything like me. Take a breath, center yourself, push away the negative bias, and then ask for advice. Some people can accomplish this in the same night. Others (like me) will need a day or two before that darkness is pushed away so I can actually take constructive criticisms.

## Summary

- Don't pimp weaknesses of players if they can't handle it (assuming you're aware of the weaknesses).

- Don't force physical moves. You may hurt someone because you don't know their body/history.

- Stereotypes are cheesy.

- The Audience is Wonderful.

- Don't give unsolicited notes. Don't ask for notes in a bad state of mind.
