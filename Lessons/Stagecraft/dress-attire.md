# Stagecraft: Dress-Attire

## Description

### Introduction

We are improvisers who play in the imaginary world where everything and every character is fluid. Does this mean that we can wear whatever we want? Not quite. Remember that you're a performer. You're an artist. You're here to create an experience for a paying audience. Most of all, you're a professional. As a professional, there's a certain standard that should be set for your attire in performances. Mainly: Clean and Appropriate for the Audience and Show

### Cleanliness

Yes, cleanliness absolutely does matter. Again, you're a professional who's performing for an audience. If you're visibly dirty, you're breaking the reality for the audience. You're either typecasting yourself as the dirty character, in which case you'll have to work much harder to break through it, or the audience will see it and typecast you, in which case they'll have to work much harder to break that mental block to accept that you're a different character. 

Cleanliness is also an element of being a good stage partner. You're going to be in close vicinity with your teammates for an hour. If you stink or are clearly dirty and it's a matter that you could have easily changed but decided not to, you're being disrespectful to your teammates. When people don't want to play with you, you will not get opportunities to play.

### Audience/Show Appropriate

Recognize that people will judge you based on your appearance. If you're playing for a high-class, formal affair, make sure that you're dressed a little nicer than a t-shirt and shorts. Of course, as improvisers, we do have some leeway because of the unpredictable nature of our craft, but this simply extends the range of appropriate attire, it doesn't remove the range altogether. 

This also applies to dressing too formally for a casual occasion. You can do it, but it may limit your range of characters (ahh, typecasting again), and it may restrict your ability to engage in physical movement. Also, there's always the possibility of your teammates feeling upstaged by your tux.

If you're expected to have to make big physical movements, make sure that your clothes can handle it. You don't want any wardrobe malfunctions through ripped clothes or body parts flopping out.

### Distraction Free

Keeping your clothing distraction free is always a great idea. Neon colors, ironic slogans on t-shirts, and worn clothes distract the audience from the true magic on stage.

### Good Rule of Thumb

If you're new to an established troupe, look at what the pre-existing players wear each night. This is the easiest way to be appropriate to the show and fit in with the rest of the cast. 

### Emcee Exception

If you're the Emcee, you can either follow the Rule of Thumb and dress accordingly with the rest of the troupe, or you can take it a small step higher. I usually will dress casually and then throw on a sports jacket to give myself the air of authority.

## Summary

- You're a professional. Be Clean and Appropriate for the Audience and the Show.

- Make sure your clothes can handle your movements.

- Fit in with the other Players.

- Emcees can go a step above.
