# Earning the Controversy

## DESCRIPTION

### Introduction

We've all guffawed harder than we care to admit at some raunchy material. We've also gasped and widened our eyes as we wonder, "Holy crap, does he really think that's funny?" If we isolated those two moments and deconstructed the actual jokes, what are we likely to find as the root causes for the different reactions to jokes that delve into controversial territory?

### Children

This may be the easiest one to gauge. Frankly, take a look out into the audience before the show and inform everyone in your cast if you see kids sitting out there.

If you're doing a show in an all-ages venue and there are young children in the audience, then it's clear you need to avoid:

- Obscenities

- Blatant Sexual Humor 

- Dark Topics

#### Obscenities

With regards to obscenities, everyone knows the obvious words to avoid, but sometimes a word such as "piss" may be too much. So err on the side of clean here. The English language is so bountiful when it comes to synonyms that using something like pee or urinate instead of "piss" is fairly easy, and could even be funnier depending on the circumstances.

#### Blatant Sexual Humor

Think of Disney here. There are many innuendoes used in Disney films that flew straight by my head as a child, that make me currently think, "Hey... that was super dirty. I watched this as a kid?" If you can pull off complex innuendoes, fantastic. You get to do that in front of children, because it'll be fairly obvious that the kids won't understand it and it's okay.

On the other hand, just talking about reproduction, the primary body parts involved, and even pantomiming sexual acts in an obvious manner are big no-nos. Not only will the children be alienated (because it'll be fairly clear that what you're doing is inappropriate), but the adults will feel badly as well because they know that there are children present.

#### Dark Topics

Death in most of its forms is a pretty big downer in a show. We can explore it in front of a mature audience, typically, but if there are children present who haven't yet had the distinct pleasure of struggling mentally with their mortality (hopefully all), please don't delve deeply into the concept of someone dying. I was in a Murder Mystery Theme Show once and I didn't make my deaths realistic whatsoever. I could have, but I knew there were children present so I just made it look like I was going to sleep.

As an addendum onto Death, don't discuss the Afterlife too much. If a child has come to terms with Death but hasn't made the jump to thinking about what happens afterwards, don't force them to make that jump. Playing Heaven is fine. Discussion of Hell, purgatory, and even Atheist beliefs about the Afterlife may make children cry. And you don't want children to cry in your show.

Additionally, there are other topics that are fairly easy to grasp and are a little too real. Err on the side of caution if you plan on joking about these things. 

### Religion

This is a bit more difficult to figure out. I personally live in a religious state, so any show that's not Adult-Only is bound to have some religious presence in the audience. I will always respectfully play any aspect of religion. If your state is less religious, you can probably get away with poking fun at religions. Stereotypes here are difficult to play, so I steer clear of them. Hopefully your emcee is a good gauge of the crowd and will be able to avoid taking blatant religious suggestions if you're in a position like me.

### Politics

Ooo wee! A good political joke can kill, but be careful with how you play specific topics. Things such as Abortion (Planned Parenthood), Gun Control, Affirmative Action, Climate Change, and the like are likely to have big proponents and opponents in the crowd. You can do it if you do it with wit, but remember that this is another line that you need to tiptoe if you want to avoid offending swaths of your audience.

### Obscenities

Of course, this had to rear its head again. Outside of the Children element, recognize when you can use obscenities and when it's a crutch. A lot of people just like to insert an F-bomb or other classic obscenity to emphasize a point and to get a quick laugh (because the shock of an obscenity is funny sometimes). If the crowd is receptive, go ahead. Just don't overdo it, or they will grow tired of it and your attempts will be met with groans rather than shocked laughter.

### Blatant Sexual Content

Yep, there's a trend. Even though the threshold for Adults is clearly higher than that for Children, there IS still a threshold. You can get gradually dirtier but don't be the person who always jumps into the darkest pits of filth, or you may be labeled the dirty-minded player who can't be funny any other way.

### Dark Topics

Dark Topics are difficult to make funny. Not impossible, but difficult. If you venture forth into areas of serious illness (cancer is a popular suggestion) or domestic abuse, bare in mind that you're probably going to be touching some nerves of members of the audience. 

There are also topics that shouldn't be touched or even hinted at on-stage, because you're going to lose every single person. Pedophilia, Rape, stuff like that is going to be hell for any improviser. If you pimp this onto anyone, they will despise you.

The only way to play the Untouchable topics is to make that person lose horribly. Even then, there's likely to be a sour taste in your audience's mouth for having that element involved in any way.

### I Walk the Line

The way to play controversial topics is to play it one beat at a time. If you're in a long scene and you're expected to play an element of religion (missionary, Jesus, God, etc), don't immediately hit everyone on the head with the worst stereotypes possible. Stay true to the character, even if you disagree with the character. If you're going to satirize or poke fun at the character, remember to take baby steps. A little joke at first to see if the audience is receptive. If they are, gradually build it up. If you're clearly showing wit and respect, they'll warm up to the bigger and more extreme punchlines as you go.

The same goes with something like sexual humor. If you jump in and all you're doing is extreme dick jokes, then the audience typically isn't having any of it. But if you can show that you're putting the effort to make solid, strong innuendoes and double entendres off of the suggestions you're given, you can gradually increase the severity of your lines until you hit that button.

The main exception to this is if I have no idea what the audience is into and the game is a short one a la Pick Up Lines in a short form set. In that scenario, every now and then (not always, because otherwise I'm just That Guy) I'll be willing to jump on a grenade and see if the audience is receptive to a filthy line. This does serve the purpose of giving the rest of the players a bar, which may signify that cleaner is the way to go or that the audience appreciates the dirt.

## Summary

- Be mindful of kids. If you need to go dirty, make it Disney Innuendo rather than Blatant.

- Be mindful of how your show is billed and your audience.

- Gauge the time so you can gradually increase severity of your treatment of a controversial topic.

- Stay true to the character rather than relying on stereotypes.
