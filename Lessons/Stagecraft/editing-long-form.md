# Editing In Long Form

(credit to Chris Bodily)

## DESCRIPTION

### Introduction

Short form has the luxury of a dedicated emcee who announces and explains the games, channels suggestions, and edits games. Long form requires every player to be constantly vigilant and aware because any moment could require a sudden edit. Everyone must be able to step in and become that emcee so that the show can move and progress properly.

## EXAMPLES

### **Wipe:** 

The _Wipe_ is the most fundamental edit. One might argue that it's the most important edit. The _Wipe_ generally consists of a player walking/running in front of a scene, breaking the reality in order to end the scene. This may or may not be accompanied by a "Woosh" or similar sound, I suppose it depends on whether or not there are players who will not be able to see/hear/sense the movement alone for the _Wipe_. The _Wipe_ ends a scene so that a different scene may take place.

### **Walk-On:** 

The _Walk-On_ is the edit that most short form players will be aware of, particularly with respect to scene-based games that involve more than two players. Most of the time, two players will begin the scene and a third will _Walk-On_ at an appropriate time to elevate the scene. The _Walk-On_ Player may come in and become another player in the scene, or they may simply step in to provide additional information and leave (provide menus as the server to establish the setting as a restaurant).

### **Tag-Out**: 

The _Tag-Out_ is a very flexible edit. Generally speaking, it is used to provide additional information that will heighten the existing scene, while maintaining one or more players from the existing scene.

**Tag-Out Example**:

**Player A:** "You're a fantastic kisser."

**Player B:** "I learned from the best."

(**Player C** tags **Player A**, which signals **Player A** to leave, **Player B** to stay for a scene)

**Player C:** (while applying makeup) "All right, son, it's time to teach you how to kiss."

(**Player A** tags **Player C,** which signals **Player C** to leave, **Player B** to stay for the continuation of the original scene)

The key element in a _Tag-Out_ is that the player who was tagged out (**Player A**, in the above example) is likely going to need to return for the original scene. The impetus is on **Player A** to remain attentive so that he/she/they may be able to tag back in on an appropriate button. This requires trust, as it is very likely that **Player C** is simply here for a quick moment and **Player A** must be ready to end that moment.

### **Tag-Run:** 

A _Tag-Run_ is a series of _Tag-Outs_, generally building in a logical fashion. If we were to do a _Tag-Run_ with the above kissing example:

**Player A:** "You're a fantastic kisser."

**Player B:** "I learned from the best."

(**Player C** tags **Player A,** which signals **Player A** to leave, **Player B** to stay for a scene)

**Player C:** (while applying makeup) "All right, son, it's time to teach you how to kiss."

(**Player D** tags **Player C,** which signals **Player C** to leave, **Player B** to stay for a scene)

**Player D:** (steps forward shakily with the help of a walker) (elderly voice) "Your father is pretty good, but let me show you who the master truly is..."

(**Player E** tags **Player D,** which signals **Player D** to leave, **Player B** to stay for a scene)

**Player E:** (comes in on all-fours) "Ruff!"

(**Player A** tags **Player E,** which signals **Player E** to leave, **Player B** to stay for the continuation of the original scene)

_Tag-Runs_ should generally operate in a Rule-of-Threes, in which the joke can be elevated so much before it gets old. There are exceptions, but usually three-in-a-row is the strongest choice.

### **Side-Edits:** 

_Side-Edits_ are a great way to support your team. Generally these consist of providing sound effects from the back-line (providing the mood, establishing the location, etc.) or players coming in to narrate some element of the setting (a la Scene Painting).

**Example of _Narrative Side-Edit_ in Scene**:

**Player A:** "You're such a good kisser!"

**Player B:** "I learned from the best."

**Player C** _Side-Edit_: (walks in, signals to **Player A's** chin) "There's slobber dripping from his chin." (leaves)

_Side-edits_ provide additional information for the audience that helps to further build the world of the scene.

### **The Clap:** 

_The Clap_ is a way of keeping the existing players in the scene but simply moving them along time (past or future, but past is used most often). Generally, if you clap, you must initiate the idea for those existing players.

**Example of The Clap**:

**Player A:** "I can't believe you did that to your boat!"

**Player B:** "I had to send it a message."

(**Player C** _Claps_ and comes in as a violinist, slowly tilting)

**Player B:** "Unsinkable, my ass." (**Player C** _Claps_ again, signaling to **Players A** and **B** to return to the original scene)

The primary difference between this and the _Tag-Out_ for moving along time is that a _Clap_ keeps all players while a _Tag-Out_ keeps only the untagged one(s).

The key with edits in Long Form is the make them consistent. Sure, you can use certain edits in place of Wipes, but then it's difficult to work with other troupes and new players because you lose that consistency. These are but a few of the many edits available, but they should be sufficient for basic long form practice.

## SUMMARY

- Wipe to End.

- Tag-Out the person you want to replace.

- If you were replaced in a Tag-Out, be ready to Tag back In.

- Tag-Runs should build in a logical fashion. Rule of Threes is a general rule.

- Side-Edits are fantastic support. Sound Effects and Narrated Scene Painting.

- Clap to keep both players in a time-dash.
