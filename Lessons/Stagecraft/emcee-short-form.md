# Emcee for Short Form

## DESCRIPTION

### Introduction

A good emcee is key to a short form show. Emcees provide the bridge from the audience to the show. They explain the show, improv, how games are played, and keep the show flowing to the audience's tastes. From the performance standpoint, emcees provide energy, additional jokes to maintain momentum, and end games at their best moment, allowing that energy to fuel the next game.

### The Most Important Part

I'm going to go out on a limb and say that The End is where we should begin. When I reference The End, I mean ending games and the show at appropriate times, so the audience has a great last impression of every section of the show.

The emcee must remain constantly vigilant because it's up to her/him/them to listen for an appropriate Button on which to end a game. These buttons are those laugh points or major reaction moments that come about naturally during an improv set. If the Button is reached but the game or scene isn't ended, then the momentum is lost and the players have to work to build it back up. If it was a particularly big Button that was missed, the audience's impression of that game or scene will have been tainted.

Err on the side of too early. If you're playing Understudy and the last scene hits a big button on the first line, end it! That's why you must be ready at all times as the host. You never know when the killer moment will happen, so you need to have that big booming voice ready to transition the players out of that game.

### Knowing Your Players

Know how I said the last section was the most important? This is actually the most important one. If you don't know the players at all, then you're already starting the show with a big handicap. 

Sure, we're improvisers, we should be able to rock-and-roll with anything, right? But remember the cardinal rule: make your scene partners look fantastic. If you don't know their strengths and their weaknesses, it becomes much harder to get the right ask-fors and thus suggestions for your players to look like geniuses on stage.

If I have never played with someone before and I'm to emcee for them, I will get to know them a bit before the show begins. Specifically I like to ask them about their strengths and what they like to do on stage.

### You're Just As Important

Now, this doesn't mean that you're the star. The show takes precedence and you're the major facilitator. When you host, you need to take it seriously. Every moment you're up there, you're performing, too! Emcee is not a throwaway role. It demands its own energy, its own level of importance. The show is your scene partner. Make it look good.

### Energy is King

I like to bring as much energy to my emceeing as I bring to my performances. Why? Because I'm setting the standard for the players! I'm getting excited and pumped from the first moment to the last. It's palpable, because energy is contagious. If you're excited, your players will feel that and play with it. If you're bored, they will feel that and be affected by it, too.

### Know Your Games

You should know every single game that's going to be played that evening/day. You should know them inside and out, to the point that you can present them succinctly and powerfully to the audience. If you find yourself stumbling about, you don't know the explanation well enough. 

Remember, you're just as important to the show as everyone else. Your role is just as important as everyone else's role. You have the advantage, however, of being able to practice key elements of your role before the show begins. In front of a mirror, in front of a camera, in any case you have the opportunity to state the key points and figure out ways to smooth out your speech. 

When you are confident about the elements that aren't changing, you free up the ability to handle the elements that are changing. If you're worried about banter with the audience, which isn't as easy to practice on your own, make sure your regular "script" is on point first. This is the minimum standard and gives you the opportunity to focus more on your off-the-cuff riffing with the audience because you know that you will rock the constants of the emcee role.

### What I Like To Do

#### Voice

My voice is the bone of my sword. I use a specific tone and volume when I emcee, so I can express authority and confidence to the audience. They know that I'm in charge and my voice reinforces that. I choose a deep, booming voice, which works with my naturally low speaking voice, and always speak from my diaphragm so I can project properly.

Whenever I end a game, I like to say "And that was (name of game)!" I try to channel the "Let's get ready to rumble" boxing guy, particularly in the game name portion. This allows me to take the energy of their button and use it in my explanation of the next game. Sometimes the game ends on a very special line that makes me laugh, in which case I'll repeat the line in order to relish the memory that my teammates created for me.

#### Ask-Fors

Asking for suggestions is an art form. It's fairly easy to do when you have a willing audience (say... at a workshop full of improvisers), but sometimes it'll take the audience a bit to warm up to you. I like to prime the pump a bit before I subject the audience to the silent pressure void in which they must throw out suggestions, particularly if the Ask-For is a little more complex. 

For instance, if I want a location for my first suggestion of the night, I won't just say, "I need a location." I like to stall a little for the audience to think. Something like, "All right, everybody, in this scene, we need a location. Geographic location, nongeographic location, it doesn't matter. Just any suggestion for a location to inspire these two improvisers." It looks long, but it takes just a few seconds and fills the silence that might otherwise plague a new, fresh audience that is hesitant to shout out. After it seems like people are warmed up, you can go ahead and ask for simple suggestions quickly, "All right, for these guys, I need a regular relationship!"

Additionally, if you're asking for more difficult suggestions, go ahead and give some examples so the audience isn't afraid of being wrong. If you want a movie genre, mention a few common movie genres so they know what you want. "For this particular game, I need some movie genres! Romance, Action, Thriller, shout out what you want to see from our players!"

When it comes to getting the audience warmed up and involved, it helps to have some introduction of the concept of improv to the audience before the show. As the emcee, that job falls upon you. Step up and talk to the audience about how you'll all be making it up on the spot and will periodically be needing suggestions from the audience! At this point I would ask for really simple suggestions to get them in the mood for giving suggestions, like "What are some of your favorite colors? Shout them out now!" or "What's an object you use every day?" Make sure you address these suggestions so the audience knows that you're listening and that you're on their side when they work up the courage to shout out what they're thinking.

#### Practice Makes Perfect

If we have a run-through of the show beforehand, I like to practice exactly as I would play in game time. This helps me get my jitters out and helps me figure out how I want to explain each game before I need to do it in front of an audience. Having someone watch and keep track as I practice is supremely useful, so I don't forget any vital steps in the games (reviewing elements of guessing games, reviewing suggestions for scenics games like Revolver).

#### Watch Standup Comedians

There are a lot of standup comedians who handle the audience very well. Watch them, analyze them, and pick up things you find congruent to your style. Talk Show Hosts are also fantastic at this, as they can handle anything that comes at them in a friendly manner (not always the case for standup comedians).

#### You Own The Stage

Not literally, but treat it as though you do. You're the emcee. The players will listen to you. The audience will listen to you. You're the lead singer who slaps hands with the audience in the front row. You're the favorite teacher who cracks jokes during class. You're the inspirational speaker who uses compelling stories and humor to draw people in.
