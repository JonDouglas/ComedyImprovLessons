# Preparation for a Show

## DESCRIPTION

### Introduction

Is it your first show? Maybe it's your second show and you want to do better this time. This lesson is about the buildup to a show, the nerves surrounding it, and how to deal with it. 

### First Time Nervousness: Butterflies

I'm not going to tell you not to worry. You may have those butterflies in your stomach a week in advance. You may have them a month in the advance (I did). You may not be hit by them until 30 minutes before the show. You may not be hit by them ever. In any case, great! Those butterflies can give you additional strength, if you manage them properly.

That sense of urgency and worry is anxiety-inducing. If you have them before the day of the show, you can use that energy to give yourself more oomph in practice. Before you practice, try to access it by thinking about the show and how nervous you are about it. You're facing this head on with this approach. It will make your practice daunting. It will make your scenes stiff. The reason I would do this is because it gives you the chance to practice as you would perform: under pressure. Of course, it's not the same without an audience, but the internal struggle that comes about is something that you will have to deal with.

It's not as bad as your fears would have you think. It's easy to go to the most negative scenario and replay that in your head, but overall that scenario is unlikely. If it's your first show, the emcee will usually mention this and you will have some leeway from the audience. If it's a class show, then the entire cast will have some leeway from the audience. Either way, failure is not a big deal. Everyone has their moments where they freeze. Everyone has their moments where they say something offensive. Everyone has their moments where they are bad scene partners, breaking rules in the worst ways possible. 

It's fine. Don't worry about it. The butterflies in your stomach can give you strength. If anything, they're there specifically to give you strength. That nervousness, that fear, is the base physiological response and it's up to you to use it. Fight.

### Second (Third, Fourth, One Hundredth) Show Expectations

"I'm going to make this show even better than before! I'm not going to make the same mistakes, it's going to go great!" Please, I recognize that everyone wants to improve continuously, but don't set this up in your mind as a mantra before or during the show. Improv is an unpredictable beast. There are so many variables that cannot be controlled, it's difficult to objectively say, "I did so much better this time than the last!" I've seen many an improviser fall into this trap and give up because they felt they were regressing after two shows (the first show being good and the second show being good but they felt like they didn't do as well).

Sure, you can work on doing certain things in a show. Don't focus on "This show is going to be better than my last." That'll get you in your head. If a joke doesn't land, you'll think, "Crap, this was supposed to be better than my last." Then the spiral begins. Those harsh expectations will make the rest of the show difficult. "I need to do something in the next scene to make up for that. I need to do something now. Why can't I think of anything now? Why am I so bad?..." Maybe it's just me that goes through this. I hope so, but if you can relate, then you know that making it a point to have a better show every single time is a journey of pain and suffering.

How do we incorporate improvement into shows, then? It's simple. Put it all on objective bases. You know if you used a weird character. You know if you took a fall in a line game for the team. You know if you used pantomime in all your scenes. These are objective, yes-or-no facts about the show. If you want to improve on using pantomime, give yourself a goal of using pantomime in all your scenes. If you want to use more characters, give yourself a goal of using characters in all your scenes. These are objective elements that you can focus on in a show without worrying about whether or not the audience is receptive to it. These are elements of a show that you can focus on doing that are concrete. Doing a good show is abstract. Being a character with an different voice once in a show is concrete.

### Optimal Condition

I am usually fairly relaxed in preparation for a show. That day is designed to get all the stress of the work week out of my body so I can be totally present without a obligatory thought in my mind. I plan for a good night's sleep the night before, and time everything so that my moments of exhaustion (I recognize that I tend to get sleepy after so many hours of being awake, so I try to space my day out different compared to a work day) will happen after the show.

I eat my favorite foods during the day, for optimal performance. I would be careful if those foods disagree with your digestion, of course. The point is that I bring myself into peak state. I enjoy my food and I enjoy my drinks so that I can be at my happiest before the show.

If I happen to be tired before the show (perhaps the timings didn't work out), that's okay. I'll drink some coffee or something to get that energy in. Everything I do is for the best interest of the show.

Activities that I plan for the day are usually ones that I would enjoy doing. Going to hang out with friends, going to a party or a festival, checking out some museums, etc. Sometimes I have to work, but if I can manage it, I'll do something to unwind so I don't get stuck in a work mindset when I get on stage.

Of course, being in optimal condition is not required. But with how many variables exist in improv, I like to handle the ones that I can control, so I will be in the strongest mindset to handle the variables I can't control.

### Meeting Your Teammates

If you don't know the players, make sure to introduce yourself and chat with them. If you can, ask them about what they like to do on stage so you know how to play with them. Don't be too interrogative about this, because that can give the impression that you're trying to show that you're better than them or drag them down.

Being personable can allow you to Give Gifts to your teammates. People like to play with those who know how to make them look good. Besides, making friends is always a good thing, right?

### Getting Used to the Space

If available, take some time to traverse the play area before the show. 

- Give yourself an opportunity to recognize how big the space is so you can figure out how to project properly in the area. Frequently I see new players fail to get their punchlines across because the audience couldn't hear it.

- The lighting of the space can be fickle as well. Figuring out if there are any spots that are unlit can make the difference between a great position and a confused audience. 

- As you walk around the space, take note of how sturdy the stage is. If there are unsafe spots, take note of that and avoid making big physical moves in those areas. 

Let your teammates know about your observations, to help them with their stage presence.

## SUMMARY

- First Show? Use those butterflies. Use that energy.

- Expectations should be based on objective elements rather than subjective ones. "I'm going to take a fall in a line game tonight" is measurable.

- Being in optimal condition for a show is a factor that you have some measure of control over. Why not?

- Know your teammates so you can make them look like geniuses on stage.

- Know the space so you know how to work in it.
