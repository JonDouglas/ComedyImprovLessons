## DESCRIPTION

### Introduction

Stage Presence is a big element of improv. Thinking on the spot lends itself to a certain insecurity when it comes to the finished product. Our goal as improvisers is to make whatever we cobble together the best it can be. Aside from the practice and honing of our technical improv skills, the delivery of those skills is key and is what we'll be discussing here.

We are performers and artists. Our craft is the process of creating magic from thin air. The audience expects to see professionals at work, otherwise they could just play Charades or any other group party game designed to get people out of their shells. As we are improvisers, we must conduct ourselves as such. If we step out to say a joke, we hold it in highest esteem. The clearest example of Stage Presence in Improv is seen in Line Games of the pun-tacular variety.

### Stage Presence: Line Games (Puns)

Examples include World's Worst, Pick-Up Lines, Scenes Not Seen

#### Step 1: Back Line Support

When you're in the back line of a line game, it's common to want to appear lost in thought, so you don't seem like the one person who's not stepping out. I am guilty of this as well. But make sure you that you remain attentive to your teammates. Whenever they step out, recognize that you need to make them look great. Listen to them, laugh at their joke, react as you would if you were an audience member. The audience will pick up on the fact that you're having fun, you're reveling in the beautiful pun as well. A happy side effect of remaining the biggest cheerleader of your teammates is that it will help you with your own thought processes as well. It may help lead you down an uncharted road in your brain's thought process, so you may find a golden joke buried in a place you didn't think to look. It also helps prevent you from using the same joke as someone else (which is one of the most awkward things to hear as an audience member).

#### Step 2: Make Your Move with Conviction

Different people have different ways of getting to The Spot. Some people advocate dashing forward as though you're fighting to let your joke out, while others like to saunter forward like James Bond approaching a beauty (or vice versa). I use both, and I think both have their purposes. It depends entirely on your joke and your demeanor. The main takeaway is that either style of player will make their move with conviction. They have the utmost confidence in what they're presenting. This is not to say that a sheepish and shy walk is bad... sometimes the joke calls for that. Just recognize what sort of line you're conveying, and confidently use the proper means of transportation to get it there.

A common mistake among newer players is the desire to get their joke out as quickly as possible, sometimes starting it as they start their Move to The Spot. You need to complete your walk to properly project your joke to the audience, which brings us to the next step!

#### Step 3: The Plant

Once you've completed your Move to The Spot, you must plant your feet and give yourself a breath. This shows your command of the audience: your respect for them, your respect for yourself, and your respect for this hallowed space known as The Spot. You're there, you're planted, and you've taken a breath so you can deliver your killer punch. If the audience is still laughing from the last joke, then wait for them to finish. Your time up there and what you have to say deserve the same respect as anyone else. Give yourself that respect. Wait for the laughter to die down. If someone is bantering (emcee, back line, etc), wait for them to finish. Stay planted and deliver your joke. 

#### Step 4: Sit In It

This may be the most difficult step. After you've delivered your joke, it's time to relish in it, whether you rocked it or not. If your joke killed, this is your opportunity to stand there and take in all the laughter and applause. If your joke was met with silence/groans, you've earned that, too! The beautiful thing is, sometimes it just takes a second for the audience to connect your joke with the topic. Sometimes you standing there, soaking in the silence, is all it takes for them to give you an extra few seconds of contemplation. Sometimes those few seconds are all it takes to transform a tumbleweed into gold. Sometimes you just have the silence. And silence is golden.

#### Step 5: ______

There is no Step 5. I feel as though everyone does a great job already of stepping back into the back line, so I'm not too worried about that. The only way to learn if you dragged a joke out too long is to face it, otherwise you may be prematurely cutting yourself off.

### Stage Presence: Scene work

Improv is full of scene work. From short form games like Revolver, Understudy, and Lie Detector, to long form is all its glory, the basis of improv is scene work. In order to have strong stage presence in scene work, you must be confident. There are some players who naturally have this confidence, but some of us (AKA me, haha) need to model ourselves after the behaviors of others to get there. And it's absolutely possible! It just requires repetition. Let's take this step-by-step, for consistency and solidarity.

#### Step 1: Cheat Out

Your face, your body language, it all says something. In certain situations, you should be facing your scene partner. Generally speaking, however, you want a slight angle, so you're facing your scene partner but the audience can see the front of your body. This allows you to convey specific emotions, tone, etc. through slight changes in your physicality. This also allows the audience better aural purchase, as your projection is extending out to them rather than to the sides. 

An extension of Cheating Out is to avoid turning your back to the audience. Turning your back to the audience makes projection difficult and prevents the front of your body from being able to convey as much information to the audience. 

#### Step 2: Projection

Make sure you're loud enough to be heard by the audience. Note, this is not screaming/yelling. You can be loud through projection without having to sound as though you're yelling.

Take each element of the space into consideration: 

Ambient Sound: Is there music playing? Is there a ball game playing? Will there be lots of vehicular noise?

Audience: Are you performing for people with hearing issues? Are they inebriated? Will people be talking during your performance (placing orders, general conversation, etc)?

Acoustics: Is the structure built in a way that it's easy to project from the stage to the crowd? 

Size: How large is the area, from the stage to the back? The larger it is, the louder you will need to project. Perhaps consider a stage mic to pick up all the sounds if the space is enormous. 

Test the sound! Have someone stand in the back of the room and see if they can hear you properly while you do a scene. If you do have a stage mic, test it through basic scene work as well. Make sure that you stay within the proper area to be picked up.

Proper projection conveys confidence on stage. You're going to say what you want and you want everyone to hear it! Even when you're the shy character, whimpering, you'll be projecting so everyone in the audience can hear how shy you are.

#### Step 3: The Plant

Ah, we're repeating ourselves, aren't we? But this is crucial. A lot of people possess nervous ticks and movements. This may be touching of the face, folding of the arms, "dancing" back-and-forth from foot-to-foot, etc. If you're doing these things for the sake of a character, then carry on. 

If you're doing these things because you're nervous, then you need to address this. If you're playing the sort of seething and calm, angry character, you don't want to be "dancing" from foot-to-foot nervously. That takes away from your character.If you tend to smile when you're nervous, you don't want to smile when you start every scene otherwise you're typecasting yourself as The Smiling One every scene (provided your scene partners are gathering information from you, as they should be). 

The Plant here lies in recognizing the posture, the body language, the proximity of you and your scene partner, and maintaining it until something makes you move. Every movement has a purpose. Every gesture means something. 

Pantomime is very good for helping you maintain meaningful movements and lack thereof. If you need to go get more yarn because you don't have the right color for the next section of your Christmas sweater, then you have a reason to move. If you need to move because you feel like you've been standing there too long and you feel like scenes need movement, then you're moving for the wrong reason. 

If you don't have a reason to move and you do so anyway, you break the tension you've worked so hard to build. Saying a statement of importance (all of your statements should be important to your scene partner) and maintaining your position to allow it to drive your statement, gives you strength.

You feel it when something makes you move. You feel it when a move is not an obligation, but rather a compulsion. Here's an example of a scene in which I was compelled to move:

(My scene partner is A. I'm B. At this point she's facing me, seated, while I'm standing and facing away from her)

**Player A:** You hurt me.

**Player B:** I'm disappointed. 

**Player A:** You're hurting me.

** Player B:** I just don't understand why you couldn't do it.

**Player A:** You're breaking my heart. (at this point, her voice cracked a little into a mini-sob. I was compelled to turn my head towards her)

We maintained our positions until we had a reason to change. I felt the emotion within her build as I stayed within my own Point-of-View of disappointment. This is one of the instinctual things, where there's no hard and fast rule as to when you make the change in position. You just feel it affect you. When it does (and in this case, it was her voice cracking that really got to me), you do what you're compelled to do. If my character was more compassionate to her (different Point-of-View), I might've gone over and hugged her if I was compelled to do so. If my character was colder towards her (another Point-of-View), I might have maintained my position and required something more of her to alter me.

Your physicality is as much of a part of your Point of View as your words. Perhaps even more so. Maintain it or the strength of your words will fall as quickly as your physical fortitude.

## EXERCISES

### Line Games (Puns)

Step 1: Back Line Support

Step 2: Make Your Move with Conviction

Step 3: The Plant

Step 4: Sit In It

Step 5: ______

Choose a line game from Short Form Games.

If you have a bunch of people in attendance, great! Simply mark a spot (The Spot) on the play area directly in front of the audience. Make the players assemble a back line as far as possible from The Spot (back of the stage), so it's a journey to get there. Force them to follow the steps as they practice the games. Make them stand a second longer than would be acceptable in a show. Make sure every single one of them steps out for each suggestion, no matter how terrible they think their line is going to be.

If you don't have an audience, we can recreate that feeling of awkwardness. Mark The Spot, but this time, you as The Coach will be sitting or standing facing The Spot. They must step up to The Spot and deliver their line directly to you, following the steps above. Your goal is to never laugh and make them as awkward as possible, to train them for that awkward silence of a crowd.

Remember to encourage them if they aren't feeling like stepping up. You can tell if they're just afraid but actually have something in mind. Reward them for dishing it out and for following the steps with some compliments, so they feel better about their line and their teammates can emulate the good things that they did.

If there's no designated Coach, take turns down the line being the person staring down the person at The Spot.

### Scene Work

#### Finding Switzerland
(credit to Dave Razowsky)
(1 person with a camera or 2 people)
In order to recognize the little movements and the little facial ticks you do, find a partner or a camera and film yourself at rest for about 30 seconds. See what you do when you think you're doing nothing.

Next step is to deliver an initiation to your scene partner or the camera and try to be completely toneless and without physical affectation/movement aside from your lips. Your partner/camera will tell you if there's anything you're adding to the line. 

Key things to look for:

- Tone changes

- Pauses

- Eyebrow movements

- Arm movements

- Sighs

- Eye focus changes

- Smiling

- Leaning in/Out

- Head nodding/shaking

The goal of this exercise is to become aware of unintentional movements, tones, and other shifts. Don't get me wrong, it is fine to say a line with physical, emotional, verbal emphasis, but it must be intentional. 

In doing this exercise, I realized that I would always move my head in a specific tilt and my eyebrows would move before I said a line. I was conveying so much without being aware of it. A friend of mine realized that he smiled every time he began a scene. The key here is that everything is intentional. You aren't playing yourself on stage, you're playing a blank character and filling in said blanks as you go. If you're compelled to add a smile, recognize what that says about the character. Perhaps you're happy, perhaps you're pleased, perhaps you feel like you're better than the other character. Being aware of how you are in neutral is key to realizing when you've made a change and focusing on the significance of that change.

#### Statues Until...

Unnecessary movements abound in improv. 

Coached exercises for 2 players

Receive a location suggestion and the players begin a scene. The two players assume positions and must remain in those positions unless something requires them to move or they find a reason to do so.

Example of Something Requiring Them to Move

"It'll be an Eggplant Parmesan, Chef." - Chef goes to prepare the Eggplant Parmesan, grabbing the necessary ingredients and tools. 

Player knocks on the door - Other player may go to look at the peephole.

Example of Moving and Finding a Reason to Do So
Player crosses the stage to grab something from the fridge.

Call out any Player who makes a movement that is deemed unnecessary (dancing around, walking to the other side of their scene partner without any particular reason).

Call out any Player who stays in the position when it's clear that something is compelling movement and they're ignoring it.

Calling out sounds like such a confrontational thing. But as a coach, I guess that's the best way to put it. Your goal here is to make sure that the players are moving or not moving with purpose, while maintaining the three Steps:

Step 1: Cheat Out

Step 2: Projection

Step 3: The Plant

### Projection

#### The Chair

Speaking from your diaphragm may be difficult if you haven't been involved in Theatre, Singing, or any other sort of Public-Speaking role. One way to maintain projection is to hold a chair, its back against your chest, while you speak out into the audience.
