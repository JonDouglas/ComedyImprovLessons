# Action Figures

## Description

Number of Players: 2 

Energy: Low to Moderate


Audience Action Figures is an audience participation game in which two players start a regular scene in an unusual position and may not move anything but their eyes and mouths on their own. One or two audience volunteers (I usually use two) will move the limbs of the players, and the players must justify those choices.

### How to Play

The Emcee will ask for two volunteers and explain that they'll be moving two life-sized action figures, while the players look for willing volunteers.

The Emcee will explain that arms and legs, when moved, will freeze in those positions until they're moved again. If the volunteers want the players to walk, they may pull on the front of the player's pant leg (calf area) or tap them behind the calf (either one, you choose, just make it clear). The Emcee should demonstrate so the audience and volunteers are aware.

The Emcee then gets a suggestion from the audience (location, relationship, etc) and the scene begins!

Make sure to thank each volunteer when they head back to their seats.

## Tips & Tricks

### The Volunteer has a Phobia of Silence

Do not allow silence to set in between you and your scene partner, otherwise your volunteers will get anxious. Keep up the justifications and the volunteers will be comfortable. 

### Pimpin' Yourself and Telling Them How You Do It

Don't be afraid to pimp your volunteers. A phrase like, "I want to hug you" is a gift as it gives a relatively complex series of motions to the volunteer so they don't feel like they have to invent anything. Volunteers who are more hesitant will appreciate this.

### Friendly!

Introduce yourself to the volunteer who'll be moving you. Be friendly. This way, he/she/they will be more comfortable.

## Summary

- Make large physical gestures when being forced to move (You can justify these later)

- Keep talking about what's going on (Silence is deadly)

- Don't forget about your scenework. Although you are working with a gimmick, your scenework will shine.
