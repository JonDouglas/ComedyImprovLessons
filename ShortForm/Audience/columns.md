# Columns

## Description

Audience Columns is an audience participation game in which two players start a regular scene but every now and then they will forget their lines (usually a word or short phrase). One or two audience volunteers (I usually use two) will fill in that forgotten dialog when they're tapped on the shoulder, and the players must justify those choices.


Number of Players: 2 (1 walk-on optional)

Type: Scene, Audience Participation 

Energy: Moderate

### Setup

The Emcee will ask for two volunteers and explain that they'll be filling in forgotten bits of dialog, while the players look for willing volunteers. 

The volunteers are placed in easily accessible locations on both sides of the stage, usually at the front so they're highlighted (helps with hearing them as well).

### Begin the Scene!

After the explanation, the players begin the scene and start off with slow and deliberate setups for the volunteers to fill in.

Player A: "I was hoping you'd be here. I need your ______." (Taps Volunteer's shoulder)

Volunteer: "Body."

Player A: "Yeah, I just want you so bad."

### Working with Volunteers

If an volunteer is particularly quiet, don't be afraid to repeat what he/she/they said for the sake of the audience and your fellow players.

Try to go to both columns so you aren't making one volunteer your designated hitter.

Make sure to thank each volunteer when they head back to their seats.

## Tips & Tricks

### Innuendo Outuendo

If a volunteer is particularly rowdy and risque, do the old switcheroo and justify all his/her/their lines into innocent ones. It can become a fun game within the game. 

### Don't Neglect the Foreplay

Start slow and build up to faster and faster setups. Sometimes you can call back previously said words and weave them together by running back and forth between columns. This urgency can really pay off and helps elevate the energy of the scene.

## Summary

- Setup dialog to allow the volunteer to justify

- Make your volunteer look as good as possible

- Don't drop your scenework
