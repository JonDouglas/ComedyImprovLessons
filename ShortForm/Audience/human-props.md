# Human Props

## Description

Audience Human Props is an audience participation game in which two players start a scene but every prop they wield will be replaced by an audience volunteer. One or two audience volunteers (I usually use two) will become the props necessary for the scene.


Number of Players: 2 

Type: Scene, Audience Participation 

Energy: High

### Setup

The Emcee will ask for two volunteers and explain that the players will be engaging in a high action scene that requires props which will be filled in by audience members, while the players look for willing volunteers.

The Emcee should demonstrate how he would become a coffee table or something that the players might use so the audience and volunteers are aware.

The Emcee then gets a suggestion from the audience (try to make it high action a la action movie so there's always something for the volunteers to be) and the scene begins!

### Volunteering to Be Funny

Try to set up the audience volunteers properly by saying things like "Let me get my gun" or "That's a beautiful jetski."

Be mindful of your volunteers. If they're clearly physically incapable of certain things or simply uncomfortable with certain positions (like saying that you're going to ride a jetski), don't do it or find ways to do it that don't endanger them.

Make sure to thank each volunteer when they head back to their seats.

## Tips & Tricks

### Places to See, People to Do, Wait, I meant-...!

Though generally scene work dictates a focus on relationship in that specific location, don't be afraid to move from place to place so you can explore different means of transit and other unusual fun objects.

## Summary

- Make bold choices, but respect boundaries

- Make your action obvious, so your volunteer knows exactly what to do

- Don't be afraid of changing the location in the scene if needed
