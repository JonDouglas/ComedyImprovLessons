# Sound Effects

## Description


Number of Players: 2 (1 walk-on optional)
Type: Scene, Audience Participation 
Energy: Moderate

Audience Sound Effects is an audience participation game in which two players start a regular scene for which a random audience member will provide all the sound effects.

### Setup

The **Emcee** will explain that this is an audience participation game (watch the people look away and shrink into their seats), and that we'll need one volunteer who'll provide the sound effects for a scene. As this is explained, the other players should search for a willing volunteer from the audience. 

Said volunteer is given the microphone and the **Emcee** gives the volunteer a couple examples to get him/her/them warmed up.

### Emcee Examples

"Say that **Player A** is opening a door, what might that sound like?"
(**Player A** pantomimes opening a door)
(Audience member provides creaky door sound [usually])

"Say that **Player B** just stepped in something gross, what might that sound like?"
(**Player B** pantomimes stepping in something gross)
(Audience member provides squishy sound)

### Let's Begin!

Once the audience member seems prepped, the **Emcee** will ask for a suggestion for the scene. Usually location, issue, or relationship are solid ones.

### The Volunteer is a Genius

It's up to the players to justify every sound that's made, good or bad. If a gun is fired and it sounded weird, say something to justify it without making the volunteer appear too foolish. 

Good example: "oh, I haven't oiled this musket in ages!"

Bad example: "well, that was clearly not a gun shot."

The volunteer is going to be self-conscious but will warm up to you if you show that you're supporting his/her/their sound effects.

Set up the volunteer for sound effects. Sometimes it's good to slow down when you build it up, so the audience member is sure to catch it. 

"Well, keep a close eye, sonny, I'm going to shoot this winchester rifle and hit that duck." 
- wordy, but it'll set up the volunteer in a clear and easy way

Make sure to thank each volunteer when they head back to their seats.

## Tips & Tricks

#### It's Not Radio
Scene work, scene work, scene work. Maintain a coherent scene while giving clear indications as to possible sound effects. This helps with silence and gives the volunteer time to rest in between Sound Effects.

#### The Musical Fruit
Don't be afraid to use farts as a weapon. If you hear a sound effect that sounds like a fart, go ahead and treat it like a fart. "Oh, excuse me" (wave away but fumes). Sometimes you can do this when the volunteer is doing fantastic sound effects for the sake of a laugh, to break up the monotony.

## Summary

- Make large gestures that should warrant a sound

- Comment on sounds that don't sound as they should

- Don't drop your pantomime!

- Maintain your scenework
