# Late For Work

## Description

Number of Players: 3

Type: Guessing

Energy: Moderate to High

Late For Work is a guessing game. One player, The Guesser, leaves the room and the Emcee asks the audience for three reasons why that player is Late For Work. The reasons will increase in difficulty with the first being the normal, easy one, and the third being the most difficult and outlandish excuse. Another player is The Boss, who wants to fire The Guesser and is listening to these excuses. The third and final player is The Co-Worker, who works at the establishment and must use pantomime behind The Boss' back to convey the three excuses to The Guesser, as The Guesser tries to express them to The Boss.

### How to Play

#### Roles

There are three roles in Late For Work: 

1: Guesser

2: Boss

3: Co-Worker

The Guesser leaves the room while the Emcee asks the audience for three reasons as to why The Guesser is late.

#### 1st Reason (Mundane)

The first reason is really mundane. This should be a simple reason why you might be late to work. It should be fairly easy to pantomime and give your co-worker time to think of how to pantomime the next guess.

EXAMPLE FIRST REASONS: 

- Alarm clock didn't go off. 

- Car wouldn't start.

- Locked keys in car.

- Stuck in Traffic.

### 2nd Reason (A little more crazy)

The second reason is a little more complex and difficult. This is where you gauge your Guesser and Co-Worker. If The Guesser is great at reading Pantomime and word vomit, and the Co-Worker is great at pantomime and list-building, go ahead and move into crazy territory now. If not, just go a bit harder.

EXAMPLE SECOND REASONS:

**EASY**:

- Saved a child from a burning building.

- Abducted by aliens.

- Became a Rock Star.

**HARDER**:

- Saved Gary Coleman from a fire in the White House

- Abducted by a UFO full of Sasquatches.

- Became Prince.

Note that the slightly more difficult ones simply involve more specifics, either there are more details or the details are more zoomed-in than before (Rock Star vs Prince).

### 3rd Reason (Extremely crazy)

The third reason is the closer. This is the craziest, most outlandish reason. Again, gauge your players. The longer and more specific the reason, the more difficult it will be.

EXAMPLE THIRD REASONS:

- Food poisoning from Jello spiked with Captain Morgan.

- Apocalypse because Care Bears took over the World with Candy Cane guns.

- Sword fight with Christopher Walken, who was using a florescent light while The Guesser was using a licorice whip, and won a trophy of Yoda and Bob Ross on a see-saw.

### Begin Play

The Emcee will call The Guesser back into the room, who has to plea for lenience from The Boss, eventually reaching the point where The Guesser reveals that he/she/they have three reasons to present. The Co-Worker will help from behind the Boss' back, pantomiming each reason to The Guesser. The game concludes when The Guesser has stated all of the reasons.

## Tips & Tricks

### Never Give Up (The Guesser)

Keep guessing, no matter what. Of course, leave openings for your Boss to chime in in the conversation, but if there's no move to talk from The Boss, just keep guessing more and more and more. Silence is going to be awkward here. Just keep talking.

### Silence Is Golden (The Boss)

If your Guesser is on a roll, let The Guesser talk. Chime in with puns and references if The Guesser is struggling, but don't go overboard making it easier.

### Let It Go (The Co-Worker)

If one pantomime isn't getting across, don't keep doing it. Find another way to convey the idea. Sometimes you need to start a pantomime from the beginning, so there's a coherent train of thought rather than just expressing characteristics.

### What the Hell!?! (The Boss)

A gag in this game is that you can turn around and look at The Co-Worker, who then has to justify whatever position their pantomime has taken them to. Do not overdo it, or The Co-Worker will be angry and the game will take too long (particularly from the audience's point-of-view).

### Thank You, Prince Eric (The Co-Worker)

Whenever The Boss turns around, you have an opportunity to interact with The Boss and The Guesser to give verbal hints as well.

## Summary

- Leave tips for the guesser if they are not on the right track

- Start new pantomime if the guesser is on the wrong track

- As the guesser, make huge assumptions to boil down later
