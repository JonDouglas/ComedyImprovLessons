# Murder Mystery

## Description

Number of Players: 3

Type: Guessing

Energy: High

Murder Mystery is a guessing game. Two Players leave the room. The remaining Player is given three suggestions from the audience: The Person who died, The Place where The Person died, and The Weapon with which The Person was murdered. Player A (the one who heard the three suggestions) must then convey these three elements to returning Player B (the first of the two players who left) using only pantomime and gibberish. Player B then kills Player A with The Weapon and must convey the three elements to Player C, also using only pantomime and gibberish. The Players receiving the information can only use pantomime and gibberish to convey their acceptance of the element.

### How to Play

The Setup

Three Players: 

Player A

Player B

Player C

Three Elements:

Person

Place

Weapon

### The Person

Player B and Player C leave the room. The Emcee asks for a suggestion for The Person who died. This is usually a famous character, fictional or nonfictional. 

EXAMPLES OF THE PERSON:

- Bill Cosby

- Fred Flintstone

- Ash Ketchum

- Michael Jackson

As the Emcee, you should gauge what you think your players are aware of. Obscure political figures and the like are more difficult, whereas a lot of common suggestions like Michael Jackson are easier. Gauge your players but don't be afraid to challenge them if they're particularly strong at pantomime and guessing.

### The Place

The Emcee then asks for a suggestion for The Place where The Person died. This is usually a nongeographic location, one where The Person wouldn't be likely found (Ronald McDonald at McDonald's would not be a good one, for example). You can make it more difficult by adding more and more specifics here.

EXAMPLES OF THE PLACE:

- McDonald's

- Wal-Mart

- The Moon

- Bathroom in The Space Station

- Poop Deck on Captain Jack Sparrow's Black Pearl

### The Weapon

Finally the Emcee asks for a suggestion for The Weapon that wouldn't normally be used to kill a person (a gun would not be a great one, but there're ways to make it more difficult). Again, more specifics and combining details can make it more difficult.

EXAMPLES OF THE WEAPON:

- Pogo-stick

- Toilet Brush

- Cane made out of Skittles

- Trophy of Wayne Gretsky

### Starting Sequence

Player B returns to the stage and reacts to a dead body on the floor. The typical sequence of the three elements is: 

- Person (denoted by a number 1)

- Place (usually denoted by number 2 or a pantomime of a rectangle/picture frame)

- Weapon (denoted by a pantomime of an actual weapon, usually a gun)

Usually the player will make a gesture signifying which element they're conveying and then puts the gesture away.

### Pantomime Basics

You can start from an earlier step in the process to get an idea across. Remember, your goal is not to "win the game" by getting the idea across quickly. Your goal is to entertain. Pantomime is entertaining, give it the time it deserves, the time the audience wants.

### Example Pantomime

(Credit to Joe DeGennaro for helping me in a discussion about this):

**Captain America**

I would start with a pledge of allegiance to get the other player to think of the American Flag. Then I would do marching with a drill instructor as a second character. Then I would have the drill instructor talk with someone else with contempt. The drill instructor is going to throw a grenade which the soldier is going to jump on. Then I'd pantomime the soldier getting an injection and becoming more buff with flexing. Then I'd do the pledge again to recapture to flag idea, grab and fold the flag, and try to weld the flag to convey metal, then draw a circle in the air to convey the shape, mime a guy shooting bullets so I can show that I'm blocking it with a shield, then throw the shield at the gunmen.

This takes the audience on a journey to Captain America, so I'm not rushing through it. It'll provide context as I'm essentially developing the ideas of America, then the Military, then calling forth a pivotal scene of the movie (sorry about the spoilers), then the creation of the character.

### Key Elements of Pantomime

- Context

- Simplicity

- Performance

#### Context

Don't rush through. Make sure you lay the groundwork so your scene partner knows what to think about your pantomime. I initially thought that pantomiming throwing a shield and hitting someone would be enough. But just seeing that pantomime doesn't give enough information. Someone might stumble into it, perhaps if they're on that mindset and they know how your mind works, but it's not satisfying. In the Captain America example, I used the Pledge, the American Flag, and the Drill Instructor to set the scene for America and the Military. The context is set up, now I just need to convey the idea of a genetically modified soldier who uses a shield.

#### Simplicity

Throwing a full character out is difficult, particularly in pantomime and gibberish. One may be able to do a perfect Cosby accent in gibberish and that may carry through, but you don't want to have to rely entirely on that to convey your ideas. Besides, if you're Player B and you just heard Player A pull off the accent, doing it again is boring for the audience. So break down the key elements so it's easily digestible. For the example above, I broke it down to establish context in a fairly easily consumable manner, then I was able to move step-by-step through key moments until I arrived at the final Captain with a shield attacking gunmen. If I just started with a guy throwing a shield and mashed the other stuff onto it, it would be a cluster of messiness without a coherent, logical train of thought.

#### Performance

You're here to perform this game. You're not here to win a contest. The overall goal is to entertain the audience. If you rapid-fire get everything right, that's impressive, but that's not always doable. Make sure that your pantomime gives the audience something entertaining instead of simply being functional for your scene partner. The example above gives the audience key reference points that are relateable, such as the Pledge of Allegience and seeing pre-Captain America jump on the grenade. Just make sure to commit to your pantomime, commit to the performance, and it will be a great game, whether or not your scene partners can rifle off the correct answers in the end.

## Tips & Tricks

### Play-Time!

Play with your scene partner a bit before you move into the three elements! Accuse Player A of killing the victim if you're Player B. Defend yourself if you're Player A. Grieve when you realize who was killed, if they were beloved.

### No Re-Runs

If your pantomime is not being understood, do something different.. Repeating the same thing over and over that isn't being received is a waste of time and the audience will lose interest.

### Moving On

If you've been watching the pantomime for a while and you're clearly not getting it, just pretend as though you do and throw it aside. Sometimes you just don't know the reference and you need to move on. 

### Over Your Head?

If you don't know anything about the reference (or don't understand it entirely), don't be afraid to repeat what the person beforehand did. You might achieve the infamous Skip, in which Player A knows it, Player B doesn't, yet Player C was able to understand it. 

### Standard of Conduct

If you do understand the reference, don't repeat pantomime you saw before (as Player B). It's boring and it seems like you're just trying to win the game. Figure out a new way to approach the material. You're an improviser!

### Two To Tango

Get involved in the pantomime, even if you're the Guesser. Find ways to be a part of the machine .If someone gets in a chair and mimes a car, jump in to the passenger seat. Don't just nod and shake your head when you get it or don't get it. Pantomime other things that may be related so your scene partner and the audience will know that you understand.

### When you ASSume... Thumbs up!

When you think you've got it, pantomime in return as though your thought is correct. If it's not, you've cleared out a possibility. If it is correct, you'll be a genius!

## Summary

- Remember that the primary goal is to entertain the audience

- Feel free to drop your current pantomime if they simply are guessing the wrong thing

- Play to the top of your knowledge in the sense of pantomime. If you know a character well, then pantomime bits only others might get. You can always come back to the easy things later
