# Party Quirks


## Description


Number of Players: 4

Type: Guessing

Energy: Low to Moderate


Party Quirks is a Guessing Game in which one player (The Host) leaves and three players (The Guests) receive character traits/characters. The Host returns to host the party. As The Host is putting the finishing touches on the dip and whatnot, The Guests arrive one at a time and give the Host hints as to what their particular character/trait is. The Host openly guesses in the course of regular chit-chat and each Guest leaves when The Host is correct, until all the Guests have been figured out.


### How to Play


#### Common Ask-Fors


The Emcee explains the game while The Host is leaving. The Emcee asks the audience for characters/character traits for the three Guests.


COMMON CHARACTERS/CHARACTER TRAITS TO ASK FOR:


Specific People:

Celebrities (Christopher Walken, Jennifer Lawrence)

Fictional Characters (Batman, Santa Claus)

Historical Figures (George Bush, Mohandas Gandhi)


Person, but special condition:

Addiction to something uncommon (Greetings, Cheeses, etc)

Fear of something uncommon (Loud Noises, Happiness, Sauces)

Dances Spontaneously (to the style of what people are talking about)

Exercise Informercial (always exercising and explaining those gains)

Is in a Movie of the Audience's Choice (is traveling through the timeline of Star Wars while at the party)

Is in a specific Universe of the Audience's Choice (is in Gotham)


Try to choose several different categories, so you don't end up with 3 celebrities or 3 addictions.


### Let's Begin!


If you like, you may ask the Audience for a suggestion for a party (Costume Party, Intervention, Sewing Party, Viewing Party are common ones that are brought up). 


The Host returns and pantomimes the finishing touches on the party (punch bowl, turning on a television, pouring chips into a bowl). 


First Guest Arrives To The Party! Usually by ringing the doorbell, The Host opens the door and invites the Guest in. 


The Second Guest should give the First Guest a little time before making an entrance. Same goes for the Third Guest in reference to the Second Guest.


As The Host figures out each of the Guests, he/she/they will be making guesses. Each correct guess should be met with thunderous applause to indicate such.


## Tips & Tricks


### Premature (Host)

As The Host, if you've a good grasp of the First Guest and the game just started, don't guess him/her/them out yet. Allow the First Guest to play a bit with the other Guests as they enter. Still play as though you're a frantic Host trying to keep everyone happy.


### Subtle to Extreme (Guests)

As a Guest, you don't need to come right out with the biggest thing ever. Make sure that you capture the spirit of your character going to a party. Start with subtle clues and finish it off with the biggest, most blatantly obvious signs of the character. If you start with the most obvious sign and go backwards, it's not quite so satisfying for the audience. Don't rush through, it's a performance!


### Help them out (Guests)

You know the other characters. If it seems as though The Host isn't quite getting it, engage in a conversation and help out. You don't need to leave when you're figured out. If you stick around and mill about (refilling the punch bowl, washing your hands, etc), you can keep an eye on things and provide support.
