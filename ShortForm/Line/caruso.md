## Description

Number of Players: ALL-PLAY
Type: Puns, Tech-Involvement
Energy: Line game, Stand-up, Low (wit-based rather than crazy physical movements)

Caruso is a line game in which the players receive suggestions and use them to formulate cheesy lines a la Horatio Caine in CSI: Miami typically after finding a dead body. Locations and professions are common choices, so you might have to create Caruso lines for use at an amusement park or by a news anchor.

List Building is the key.

Common lists (in addition to the suggestions): Death, Crime Scene Investigation, Courtroom, Lawyers, Lab, Autopsy

### Shyamalan/Twists in the Setup

There are two special twists with Caruso: 

1. A chair and a pair of sunglasses are set up at the front of the stage. The players will either put on or take off the sunglasses as they reach the punch of their line.

2. After the line is finished, it's up to the Tech booth to play The Who's Won't Get Fooled Again (the scream section).

Generally, the audience volunteers a pair of sunglasses, so take good care of them.

## Examples

Example Caruso lines:

Amusement Park
- (Look around the room) "Looks like he didn't keep his arms and legs inside the ride the entire time."
- "He must have been dead a day or so. That's the amount of time you can spend here and still have fun."
- "He was a snitch! He probably shouldn't have wandered near the game of Whack-A-Mole."

News Anchor
- "He drowned. Guess he shouldn't have taken the Title of his profession so seriously."
- "Maybe he got jealous of people looking more at the box than at him."
- "He should have stuck to the cue cards."
- "The teleprompter said, 'fade out' and he took it literally."

## Tips & Tricks

### Really, More Puns?!!?
Puns are key. You might get groans from the obvious ones, but a well-crafted pun line will kill. Confidence in delivering a pun is the best. 
IE Hardware Store. "Looks like he got screwed."

### Four Eyes are Better than Two
If you wear glasses, you have the opportunity to make a quick gag joke by figuring out a way to do it with the sunglasses anyway (putting the sunglasses over your glasses; taking your glasses off, replacing the sunglasses with your glasses, putting the sunglasses on, taking them off, replacing the glasses with the sunglasses and putting your glasses on [taking your time as you do so]).

## Summary

- Get in the habit of building lists around death

- Be sure to say the obvious puns. The audience is already thinking of them

- Let your confidence in your pun show
