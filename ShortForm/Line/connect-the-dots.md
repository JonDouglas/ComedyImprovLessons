# Connect the Dots


## Description


Number of Players: ALL-PLAY

Type: Teamwork

Energy: Line game, Low to Moderate


Connect the Dots is a line game in which one player steps forward and is endowed as an inanimate object. The other players will then step forward one-by-one and add on to the picture by becoming other inanimate objects that would fit in the picture. Once a picture has been established, the Emcee will call "Connect the Dots" and the first "object" of the picture will have the opportunity to choose to Keep any one of the other objects. That object then becomes the first object of the next picture and the game continues!


## Examples

**EXAMPLE 1**

Suggestion is Vacuum for the first player


**Player A:** "I am a Vacuum." (pantomimes becoming a vacuum)

**Player B:** (walks forward and becomes a cat) "I'm a cat that is terrified of the vacuum."

**Player C:** (walks forwards and lays behind the cat) "I'm a pickle."

**Player B:** (reacts to the pickle by jumping, a la cats when pickles are found in their space)

**Player D:** (walks forward and becomes a dog) "I'm a dog."


You'll notice that there's a little Game that has developed here. Though the picture is a little strange, we can see that the players are all on the same page of "Let's become things that scare cats." 


**EXAMPLE 2**

Let's say that Pickle was chosen in EXAMPLE 1.


**Player A:** "I am a Pickle."

**Player B:** "I am a cheeseburger."

**Player C:** "I am fries."

**Player D:** "I'm a child that doesn't want to eat the pickle."

**Player E:** "I'm an adult that is trying to force the child to eat the pickle because of the importance of vegetables."

**Player F:** "I'm the child's actual parent."


You see that the picture here continued to zoom out and out from the pickle, until finally Player F found a discrepancy in Player E's phrasing, so Player F was able to hit a punchline.


This example differs from EXAMPLE 1 in that this image is logically sound. Rather than having a bunch of things that gang up on a cat, all the players have assembled pieces of a puzzle that is more likely to be seen in real life.


**EXAMPLE 3**

Let's say that Adult was chosen in EXAMPLE 2


**Player A:** "I'm an Adult."

**Player B:** "I'm bills."

**Player C:** "I'm pressure to get married."

**Player D:** "I'm pressure to grow up."

**Player E:** "I'm childlike wonder." (inches away from the adult)


This example shows a way of developing abstract ideas. The pressures and childlike wonder are clearly things that aren't seen tangibly, but we have the opportunity to paint that picture on stage. 


## Tips & Tricks


- Every now and then there's an opportunity to Run Away from the main object. This is a game-ender, so you need to make sure that you have something incredible to go with this otherwise the energy has peaked and it'll be hard to get back. Usually, this happens with a very incomplete picture.


**EXAMPLE**

**Player A:** "I'm an Asian man."

**Player B:** (runs away) "I'm lead roles in Hollywood!"


You see that this is a clear move for a punchline. If the game doesn't end here, it's hard to build on the picture after one player has run away. If no one does, the only choice is lead roles in Hollywood.


- Don't be afraid to zoom out. If people are describing specifics and you want to paint exactly where these specifics lie, go for it! You can do a swerve and bring those elements to a fitting yet unexpected place as well for a good punch.


- Please make sure that you listen carefully. The most awkward moment in Connect the Dots comes when you paint something you had in mind from the beginning, that ties directly to the initial object, but it doesn't fit because of the world that everyone else has painted before you stepped out. I've felt it. The players feel it. The audience feels it.
