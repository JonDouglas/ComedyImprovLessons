# Hey Waiter

## Description


Number of Players: ALL PLAY

Type: Line game (Puns)

Energy: Low to Moderate


Hey Waiter is a line game in which one player steps out as a disgruntled patron of a restaurant. The Emcee takes suggestions for things you wouldn't want to find in your soup. These may be actual physical things likes shoes, poo, toes, Transformers: Age of Extinction, dvds, cars, or even abstract concepts such as communism or freedom. The disgruntled patron then yells for a waiter, at which point a player from the back line will step forward and ask, "what's the matter?" The patron says that "there's communism in my soup", to which the waiter quips, "everyone gets the same amount, don't worry" or another groan inducing joke/pun related to the object/concept. After the line is delivered, the waiter becomes the new patron, the old patron returns to the back line, and the game continues.


List building is king.


Lists I like to build here are:

Restaurant tropes (especially 5 star restaurants), food types, different cuisines of the world, manners and etiquette, elements of the human condition


## Examples


Suggestion: Shoe

"Waiter?"

"Yes?"

"There's a shoe in my soup."

"It's Sole Food!"


Suggestion: Cup

"Waiter?"

"Yes?"

"There's a cup in my soup."

"Well, you said you'd be dining Solo."


Suggestion: Chair

"Waiter?"

"Yes?"

"There's a chair in my soup."

"Oh, it looks like the line chef has been a Lazy Boy!"

## Tips & Tricks


### Like with Like

Broad categories such as TV shows or Movies are fantastic for Puns because you can go anywhere with them! Just make sure you stick with broad Puns or it will be tough to track your train of thought. 


EXAMPLE

TV SHOW IN MY SOUP

BROAD: "Tonight it's on the House!"

Too Specific: "The Chef should be more careful when he's Cuddy carrots."


The latter joke is not great, but it illustrates a joke that might hit if the suggestion was House as opposed to TV Show.


### Secret Spices

Use special accents when you're calling for the waiter or responding to the patron. It's an opportunity to put your own flavor in without overpowering the game.
