# Pick-up Lines


## DESCRIPTION


Number of Players: ALL-PLAY

Type: Puns, Innuendo

Energy: Line game, Stand-up, Low (wit-based rather than crazy physical movements)


Pick-up Lines is a line game in which the players receive suggestions and use them to formulate bad pick-up lines. Locations and professions are common choices, so you might have to create pick-up lines for use at a Movie Theatre or for use by/on a Proctologist (common suggestion). 


List Building is Key. 


In Pick-Up Lines, I usually build lists related to the following (in addition to the suggestions, of course):

Dating, Love, Romantic Comedies, Sex (if the suitable for the audience, always Disney-style innuendo rather than Blatant Sexual moves)


## Examples


Example Pick up Lines:

Firefighter

"Girl, you on fire."

"I love hose."

(Dirty)

McDonald's

"You want some of my secret sauce?"

"Oooo, girl, you super size me."

"Hey, girl, if it's not too messy, I'll climb up your slide."


## Tips & Tricks


### Puns are key. (and I'm the lock ;) )

You might get groans from the obvious ones, but a well-crafted pun line will kill. It's all about the confidence. The lamer the joke, the better the reaction if you go in with absolute confidence. You will be destroyed if you treat your bad puns as pieces of meat that you're offering to the lions.
IE Hardware Store. "How about a screw?" 

### Double Entendres!

I find that my best lines relate certain phrases to dating/relationships/intercourse. Walk the line so it's not too obvious.
IE Barista. "Nah, you don't have to introduce yourself. In the end, I'mma be calling out the wrong name anyway."

### Rating System

Analyze your crowd. Pick-up Lines have a habit of getting really dirty. Err on the side of puns if you find yourself playing for youths.
