# DESCRIPTION


Number of Players: ALL-PLAY

Type: Puns, Pop-Culture References

Energy: Line game, Stand-up, Low to High 


Scenes Not Seen is a line game in which the players receive suggestions and use them to formulate scenes that were not seen in a movie. This requires a certain amount of pop-culture knowledge, as the audience is likely to shout out suggestions of movies they've recently watched (within the last few months), movies that are loved and hated (Twilight, Transformers), major motion pictures (The Lord of the Rings, Harry Potter), and classics (Citizen Kane, Casablanca).


List Building is key here.


Lists I like to build (in addition to the suggestion) are:
Stupid movie tropes, Technology


## Examples


Example Scenes Not Seen

Harry Potter

"You like my new broom? It's a Dyson."

"You're a Lizard, Harry!"


## Tips & Tricks


### The Carlton Effect

Perhaps try to throw in a character that a prominent actor has played in another movie. 

IE Putting Gandalf in X-Men because of Sir Ian McKellan.

    Referencing Starlord in Jurassic World because of Chris Pratt


### I Ship That

Throwing in a weird relationship between two characters can be interesting. 

Like seeing two opposing characters in a romantic relationship together.


### Scene Sins

Call out clear cinematic stupidities with your scene!

IE The Notebook scene where they lay down on the street, except this time they actually do get run over.


### Don't Drop The Ball

Stay vigilant, this game usually requires outstanding support. Someone is likely to pull you out to help in their scene.


### Everything in the Scene

Keep your pantomime going in this. Maintaining the actions of the characters in the scene help establish context and commitment.
