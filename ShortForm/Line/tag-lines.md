# Tag Lines

## Description


Number of Players: ALL-PLAY

Type: Puns, Accent

Energy: Line game, Stand-up, Medium (wit-based rather than crazy physical movements)


Taglines is a line game in which the players receive suggestions and use them to formulate cheesy lines used in action movies, typically before someone is killed. Locations and professions are common choices, so you might have to create taglines for use at a library, or by a plumber. 

List Building is king.


Common lists (in addition to the suggestion): Murder, death, fighting, guns, blades, swords


## Examples


Example Taglines:


Library

"I'm going to teach you the Dewey DIE-cimal system!"

"I was talking to Death... and your soul's overdue!"

"You need a Ghostwriter? How about you become one!"


Plumber

"Your chances are being flushed down the drain!"

"He's going to be a floater."

"I'm going to WIPE you off the face of this earth."


## Tips & Tricks


### Ohhh, you're so Punny!

Puns are key. You might get groans from the obvious ones, but a well-crafted pun line will kill. Confidence in delivering a pun is the best. Let me put it this way: The best pun delivered feebly is feeble, and the worst pun delivered with the might of Zeus is worthy of Olympus.

IE Hardware Store. (fires gun) "I nailed you." 


### Aughaughaugh

Use a funny accent when you deliver a tagline. If you can do Arnold Schwarzenegger, you're golden. Others are possible, too, if you can pull them off (bonus points if you can make it related to one of their movies, too).


### How To Commit A Murder

Pantomime killing someone before your line to set the scene. Sometimes this can be used to set up a line that might not have worked if the context wasn't established.
