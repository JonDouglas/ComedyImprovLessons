# Talk Or Die / Conducted Story


## Description


Number of Players: ALL-PLAY

Type: Storytelling

Energy: Line game, Low to Moderate


Talk Or Die is a line game in which all the players must work together to tell a story. The Emcee will point at whoever should be telling the story at any moment. To make it more difficult, the players each receive suggestions for genres and styles in which they must tell the story.


EXAMPLES

Player A: Dr Seuss

Player B: Suspense/Thriller

Player C: Harlequin Romance Novel

Player D: Film Noire

Player E: Instruction Manual


If a Player stumbles, doesn't say anything, or fails to tell the story in the proper genre, the audience is cued to yell "Die!" as which point that specific player is ejected from the game and the rest of the player will continue the story at a different chapter, until all but one remain.


## Tips & Tricks


### One Is The Loneliest Number (Emcee)
Don't be afraid to end the game before there's a single winner. Sometimes the Button is hit before a Winner is declared and you gotta end it.


### You're Their First (Emcee)
You may need to set the example for the audience for the first "Die!" The audience is like a shark. Once there's blood in the water, they'll be ready to pounce on the next fumble.


### You are One
Don't just force your ideas, the best playings of this game I've ever seen involve the seamless melding of ideas because of great listening.
