# What Are You Doing?


## DESCRIPTION


Number of Players: ALL-PLAY

Type: ALL-PLAY, Pantomime, A to C

Energy: Low to High


What Are You Doing? is a line game in the Emcee asks the audience for letters. There are three stages: 2 letters, 3 letters, and finally 4 letters. In each case, after the letters have been chosen, a player will begin a pantomime. Another player will step forward and ask "What are you doing?" The responding player then replies with a phrase with words that begin with the chosen letters.


## Examples


EXAMPLE

Letters are AS

(**Player A** is eating a sandwich)

**Player B**: "What are you doing?"

**Player A**: "I'm Asking Sally!"


The player who just asked "What are you doing?" then does exactly what he/she/they heard.


EXAMPLE

AS

(**Player A** is eating a sandwich)

**Player B**: "What are you doing?"

**Player A**: "I'm Asking Sally!"

(**Player A** leaves)

(**Player B** pantomimes holding a bouquet of flowers, sprays his mouth with mint, and knocks on a door)

(**Player C** opens the door)

**Player B**: "Hi, Sally! Do you want to go out?"


### Continue on!


At a good, logical Button/Edit Moment, another player will walk up to B and then ask "What are you doing?" and the chain continues. After a few goes at 2 letter phrases, move on to 3 letters (getting suggestions from the audience), and finish with 4 letters. Remember to not repeat letters, nor to repeat words that have already been used.


## Tips & Tricks


### That's Not Where That Goes!


Take the words the wrong way. If the phrase is a common one, try to find another way to interpret its meaning and do that. The surprise will delight the audience.

EXAMPLE (Credit to Skyler Higley):

Letters are TI

**Player B**: "What are you doing?"

**Player A**: "I'm taking inventory."

(**Player B** proceeds to steal stuff)


### Zealot


Whatever you're doing, you're doing it with the utmost conviction. Bring that energy in and the audience will love you.


### Listen and Be!


Pay close attention so you can step in to support. Most of the time this game requires other players to be Johnny-on-the-spot when it comes to walking in as animals, people, etc.
