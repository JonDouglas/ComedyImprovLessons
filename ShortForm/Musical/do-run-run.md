# Do Run Run


## Description


Number of Players: Any

Type: Singing, Teamwork Rhymes, Elimination

Energy: High


Do Run Run is a classic singing game that requires good teamwork as the players tell a story together through song. Each player tries to rhyme with a suggested name from the audience. This is typically done acapella, but can also be done with musical accompaniment.


## HOW TO PLAY 


### Setup


(I'm going to use an example through this entire thing for ease)


Four players

Player A

Player B

Player C

Player D


The Emcee gets a one-syllable name from the audience and the first player begins with the chorus "Ohhhh, I met (him/her) on a (Day of the week) (Time of day) and (his/her) name was (NAME)." 


EX: Ohhh, I met him on a Tuesday morning and his name was Jack.


### Let's Begin!


Each player must create a line of dialog that will progress the story and also rhyme with the name. The same sequence repeats twice and then goes into a rapid-fire mode to keep the improvisers on their feet.


(parentheses show rhyme scheme)


Player A: I met her on a Monday and her name was Jane (A)

(Da do ron-ron-ron, da do ron-ron)

Player B: Her favorite batman character was named Bane. (A)

(Da do ron-ron-ron, da do ron-ron)

(Dadododo-yeah!)

Player C: When she did her laundry she always used Gain (A)

(Dadododo-yeah!)

Player D: She wasn't psycho, you would call her Sane (A)

(Dadododo-yeah!)

Player A: She was young she didn't need a Cane (A)

(Da do ron-ron-ron, da do ron-ron, 5, 6, 7, 8!)


You then repeat this until an improviser does not have a line or repeats a rhyme, which will eliminate them from the game. The audience typically will yell "Die!" or make a buzzing sound.


### Final 3!


Once you get to 3 players remaining, you will up the ante to a two-syllable name. Depending on your group, you can go up to a three-syllable name to make it interesting.

## Tips & Tricks


### A to B!

Run down the alphabet for potential rhymes. That gives you 26 potential rhymes with the same letters.

Listen to others to ensure you do not repeat anything prior.
