# Irish Drinking Song


## Description


Number of Players: 4

Type: Singing, Teamwork Rhymes

Energy: High


Irish Drinking Song is a classic singing game that requires good teamwork as the players tell a story together through song. The second and third player always rhyme, so the pattern is A,B,C,B. Piano is preferred, but unneeded. If you can get the audience to clap with the beat, even better!


## How to Play


### Setup


(I'm going to use an example through this entire thing for ease)


Four players

Player A

Player B

Player C

Player D


The Emcee gets a topic of discussion (let's say dating for now) and the players begin with the chorus "Ohhhh, dai, de, dai, de, dai, de dai, de dai, de, dai, de, dai." During the entire song, all the players will be pantomiming holding pitchers of beer. If you can do this with an Irish accent, all the better.


### The Pattern


Then they each sing a short line, with the 2nd and 4th players rhyming. The same sequence repeats and is followed by the chorus and then player order switches up.


## Example


(parentheses show rhyme scheme)


Chorus

Player C: She was really hot (B)

Player D: I wanted to talk to her (C)

Player A: I hope she's not a thot (B)


Chorus

Player A: She aimed it at me face (B)

Player B: But she missed me! (C)

Player C: Now it's time to race! (B)


Chorus


## Ending


You can either repeat the chorus now (but at a slower tempo that builds in volume) or repeat the final line if it's particularly good.
ALL: Now, it's, time, to, race!


## Tips & Tricks


### KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid) 

Stay with the rhythm, which usually accommodates around 4 words, depending on your syllables. No need to make it harder on yourself.


### Golf Tee (2nd Line)

Aim for single syllable words to end your lines. It'll make it easier for the 4th player to rhyme off you. 


### There May Only Be One! (4th Line)

If the 2nd Line player gives you a multi-syllable word (as in Sequence 4), don't be afraid to just rhyme off the last syllable. If you can find a multi-syllable rhyme, the crowd will appreciate it, but if all else fails, you won't disappoint if you just rhyme the last syllable.


### 2 Ears, 1 Mouth

Remember to listen. Not just the rhymers, either, but listen to everyone so you build your story properly. Notice that the example I placed above tells a coherent story. This requires every player to be on the same page.
