Energy: Low to High


Chairs is a line game in which the Emcee sets up two chairs (with backs, for ease of use) in innocuous positions on stage. Players step out of the back line and occupy those chairs, justifying their positions in-scene. After a Button is hit, the Emcee will call out "Chairs" and the two players will reposition the two chairs in whatever way they see fit. The two players coming in must sit in the chairs and justify the positions. Sometimes "sit" means having your butt in contact with the seat of the chair.


### Safety First!


Bear in mind your team's physical condition. Though it may be funny to watch someone struggle in an awkward position (and the ensuing revenge chair positioning), no one should get hurt.


## Tips & Tricks


### Variety Is The Spice of Life

Try to make your scenes as disparate as possible, to keep it fresh and new. 


### Lighten up!

You aren't obligated to give your fellow players difficult positions. A fun move is to make one chair difficult and the other chair easy, to see the fighting for the easy chair.
