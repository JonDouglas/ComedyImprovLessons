# Dead Bodies


## Description


Number of Players: 1 or 2 + however many players you want (I usually like 2-3)

Type: Scene/Physical

Energy: High for one player, overall energy is low


Dead Bodies is a game in which one or two players are supposed to reenact a historical event, a movie, or something else that is relatively action-packed, with two or more dead bodies (other players who are "killed" when they show up). The Live players are to pick up and move the bodies of the "dead" as if they were action figures representing the characters in the movie.


## Tips & Tricks


### Build It Up By Knocking Them Down

The Dead Bodies don't have to be dead at the start of the scene. The Live Player(s) can kill them off as the game is starting, allowing a little action before the game begins.


### Conceding a Tug-Of-War (Dead Bodies)

Help your Live Player(s) as much as you can without making it obvious. I prefer that the Live Player(s) lift the upper body of each Dead Body off the ground when they need to talk, rather than trying to keep everyone on their feet (which makes it pretty obvious that you're assisting). If you're comfortable and capable of falling down, do so and make it loud (keep your safety in mind, no need to crash your head onto the stage for a laugh). The process of juggling falling and misplaced bodies is entertaining.


### Hercules (Dead Bodies)

If the Living happen to be super strong, then reduce your assistance because it'll be funnier that way (Unless your safety is at risk).
