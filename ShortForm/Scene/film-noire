# Film Noire


## Description


Number of Players: 2 (maybe 3 with a walk-on... I like 2)

Type: Scene

Energy: Low


Two players receive a location/profession suggestion and play a scene out as if they were in an old Film Noire Detective show. Every now and then a player will step forward, breaking the fourth wall, and reveal his/her/their inner thoughts/monologues. The other player will freeze while the player reveal his/her/their thoughts. 


## Tips & Tricks


### Film Noire Music

This is not necessary, but it can help set the mood if you have the Film Noire sort of background score.


### Make It Count

The Step-Out moments should be very impactful. They provide a vehicle for punchlines to setups that you create in the scene. Still, maintain your Film Noire persona in both the scene and the Step-Out, for the integrity of the game.

### Eavesdropping

Listen carefully when your scene partner Steps Out. Though your character doesn't know the information, you do. Use it to make your scene partner brilliant. 
IE My scene partner Stepped Out and complained on my yellow teeth. To support his claim, I started talking with my teeth bared.

### Dirty Habit

Smoking is a common pantomime to get people going in the Film Noire Style. You don't have to do it, but it may help you set the scene. 

### Play the Private Dick Trope

Not telling you to go dirty; you can lay the scene in proper Film Noire style by stepping out and talking about the feelings you have when you encounter your scene partner.


Examples


"I knew he was trouble when he walked in..."

"I'd knew her the moment she walked in. I'd recognize that face anywhere."

"It was a day just like any other day. Until _he_ walked in."
