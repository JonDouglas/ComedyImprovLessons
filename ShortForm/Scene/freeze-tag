# Freeze Tag


## Description


Number of Players: ALL-PLAY

Type: ALL-PLAY

Energy: Low to High


Freeze Tag is a line game in which the Emcee sets up two players in strange positions on stage. They begin a scene and must justify their positions. Players on the back may call out "Freeze," at which point a player or both players may be tagged out, and the new position must be justified in a new scene. The Emcee may call out "Freeze," in which case both players must be replaced.


### Move the Action!


Work to move into new positions for your back line, so they can step into new roles instead of the one you've occupied for a while.


### Don't Hurt Me, Don't Hurt Me, No More


Bear in mind your team's physical condition. Though it may be funny to watch someone struggle in an awkward position, no one should get hurt. Be ready to step in and help.


### VARIATIONS


#### Blind Freeze Tag


Blind Freeze Tag is the same game, except all players on the back line are facing the back wall. 


Try to gauge the flow of the scene based on the word, so you can get a timely freeze.


Don't rely on the Emcee. The fun lies in your blind calls of "Freeze."


#### Double Blind Freeze Tag

Don't rely on the Emcee. The fun lies in your blind calls of "Freeze."


## Tips & Tricks


### The Fresh Prince

Like going from the posh roads of Philadelphia to the mean streets of Bel Air, try to make your scenes as disparate as possible, to keep it fresh and new.


### Pick Me! Pick Me!

Don't be afraid to replace the untagged player if someone else called "Freeze" and tagged someone.
