# Pieces of Paper


## Description 

Number of Players: 2 with a walk-on or 3 at once

Type: Scene

Energy: Moderate

Three players leave the stage as the Emcee takes suggestions of phrases to be written on small pieces of papers. These phrases may be song lyrics, movie quotes, historical quotes, or anything else you can think of. The strips of paper are strewn across the ground. The returning players are given a suggestion for a scene and they will pick up strips of paper to fill in key bits of dialog.


### How to Play


#### Setup


The Emcee should ask for broad suggestions.


EXAMPLES:

Song Lyrics

Movie Lines

Historical Quotes (difficult)

Catch phrases

Things you don't want to hear from your grandmother 


### Let's Play!


The players should play a strong scene but find ways to incorporate bits of dialog that might be applicable to the scene. Setups may include:


"My grandma always used to say this about skydiving ______"

"My dad's last words were _____"

"You know what I have to say about that!?!?! ______"


Make sure to justify each line to the scene if it's not readily apparent.


### No Cheating!!


Don't read the strip before you say it. Sneak peeks into setups are disingenuous. Make a blind setup and then make your reading as fresh as the audience's hearing of it.


### Climax


End the game either when a big Button is hit or when the last strip of paper is read aloud.


## Tips & Tricks


### Every Bullet Matters

Don't rush through the papers. If you go through all of them, the game is over. Make each one count.
