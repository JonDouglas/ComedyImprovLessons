# Revolver


## Description


Number of Players: 4 (3 is also possible, in case you have a 3v3 format)

Type: Scene-based

Energy: Moderate to High


Revolver is a four-player game in which we get to see four separate scenes revolve before our very eyes. As the Emcee calls out Rotate, the players will rotate through these scenes a la flipping through television channels. Of course, like TV, time will likely have passed when we revisit each specific scene.


## How To Play


The four players assume a 2x2 square formation, facing the audience. Whichever two players are in the Front Line are the Active Players, and thus are participating in the scene. Whenever the Emcee calls "Rotate/Clockwise" or "Reverse/Counterclockwise," the players shift positions accordingly, with two players always ending up in the Front Line. 


There are respectively four pairings in Revolver. As such, the Emcee collections four distinct suggestions for each pairing. Common categories include: Relationship (Conventional or Unconventional), Objects, Locations (Geographic or Nongeorgraphic), Emotions, Genres (Film, Television, Book). As each suggestion is collected, the Emcee will have the pairing repeat said selection and then rotate for the next pairing to receive their suggestion.


Once the game has started, it's imperative that the scenes rotate through on key Buttons/laugh points, so the energy is maintained. When pairings are revisited, the scene is either continued where it left off, time has elapsed and the pairing is found later on in a different situation (for the same "game" to be played), or the pairing takes on different roles to play the same "game" (perhaps in a different location as well).


## Tips & Tricks


### Different Strokes

Different troupes have different ways of lightening the load. Sometimes troupes expect the player in a specific position (say, stage left) to be "in charge" of initiating the scenes, thus giving each player the burden of initiating one scene.


### Constant Vigiliance!

Pay attention to the scenes going on even when you're in the Back Line. You never know when you'll need to walk in to support your teammates. Additionally, this helps you to...


### Disparate Times Call For Disparate Measures

Make your scene as different as possible from the scene before. It's boring to see the same scene in four different pairings. Find different games, explore diverse territory. 


### Irresistible Attraction, Not Incest 

You can make connection between scenes, but in order for these connections to be satisfying, the scenes must be different enough that the connection isn't a "Duh!" moment. This is why we want to find different games and explore diverse territory. To incorporate an idea from one scene into an entirely different scene because it somehow fits in naturally and hasn't been forced... that's fun.


### Mini-Harold (Long Formers)

For those who started in Long Form and haven't dipped much in Short Form, think of Revolver as a fast Harold. You establish the Game of the scene in the first showing of the scene, and then you launch into your Second Beat when you return to that pairing. Either you are the same characters, or you can put the game to use elsewhere. Just make it clear from the get-go.


### High Note!

Emcee is critical here. When a Button is hit, you must edit. Because the scenes are quicker, the momentum is found and lost more quickly as well. Stand at the ready because a Button may be hit with the first word or even the first movement of the next pairing. I've missed a huge Button once and the pressure it puts on the next rotations is enormous.
