## Description


Number of Players: 6+ (with potential for sideline support)

Type: Scene, Detail-Oriented

Energy: High


Big, Bigger, Biggest is a scene-based game in which we see a regular, relatively mundane scene, filled with specific detail. At an appropriate Button, the Emcee will end the scene and call for it to become Bigger. New players will enter and play the scene, but every element from the original scene is amplified a little bit and becomes a little more extreme. The Bigger scene is ended, again at an appropriate button, and new players enter to create the mindblowing Biggest scene, taking the Bigger details and elevating them to the most extreme level.


## Tips & Tricks


### The Devil's In It!

Give lots of specifics, particularly if you're in the first scene. These details should be low-level yet memorable. Stuff like, "I gave you a CD by Souljah Boy," or "I wrecked your moped." Each of these details will give the following scenes things upon which to build!


### I Don't Care Who You Are, Where You're From..
.
Listen! Whichever scene you happen to be in, or even if you're only there for support, listen to everything. Take in everything. Even if you were already in a scene, you can be there to help elevate the others. Perhaps one of the players needs to become a Legendary figure and you'll need to be the bottom half of his body (centaur, for instance).


### Go Hard, But Remember Your Ace

In the Bigger scene, remember to make logical jumps when you elevate the original content, so the 3rd scene is given the opportunity to build upon yours.
