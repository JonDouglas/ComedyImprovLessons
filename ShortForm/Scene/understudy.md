# Understudy


## Description


Number of players: 4

Type: Scene

Energy Level: High


Understudy is a scene-based game in which 2 players are to engage in an action-packed scene. At some point, the Director will call "Cut!" and fire one of them, whom is replaced by an Understudy (who hasn't seen the scene). The scene happens again, with one fresh player. Then the Director will call "Cut!" and fire the last vestige of the original scene, whom is replaced by the last Understudy. Now we see the final scene with the two player who didn't see the original scene.


## HOW TO PLAY


Understudy is scene-based game disguised as a guessing game. Player 3 and Player 4 leave the room so they have no idea what's going on. Player 1 and Player 2 receive a suggestion (usually the title of a made-up high-action movie) and they immediately launch into a suspenseful/action-packed/climactic scene. 


The director calls "Cut!" at the climax of the scene and fires Player 1, whom is replaced by Player 3. The scene is played again, with Player 2 trying to play the scene the same way but failing to because Player 3 has no idea what was happening aside from the title of the made up movie. 


The director calls "Cut!" at the Button of the scene and fires Player 2, whom is replaced by Player 4. Now the final scene ensues, a hilariously different enactment of the original scene by Player 3 and Player 4, with Player 3 trying to reenact what he/she/they remembered, and Player 4 making the biggest of choices based on the title, to close it out.


## Tips & Tricks 


### BIG! ASSUME! (All Players) 

Make big choices, big assumptions. Every action is signification, make it even bigger. You have all the tools ever right now. Use them all to make it so much more fun for the other players involved.


### NOT A GUESSING GAME (Players 3 and 4) 

Don't play it as a guessing game. Don't try to be correct. Hear the Title and make wild choices based on it. The Players preceding you may try to guide you down a path. Screw that. You heard the title. You read the "script". You know exactly what to do. Do it big. Who cares if you're different from the original scene? I care. I want your scenes to be so wildly different from the original scene that the audience is left breathless from laughter because you took the statement of aggression to mean a statement of seduction.


### Broad Strokes

Making broad statements is really fun because the following players will be able to interpret them as they see fit, usually leading to great reactions from the audience (if they make the same choice, everyone will think "WHAT? HOW DID HE/SHE/THEY KNOW?!, if they make a totally different choice, everyone will be delighted at the creative interpretation of the words).


### Let's get Physical, Physical

Big physical moves are wonderful. Being put in a position to get the following player to do that move or something similarly big is a great thing. 


### Characters?

If all else fails, go in as a big character. Wherever you happen to end up, you'll be an interesting change.


### Easiest and Hardest (that's what she said) (Player 4)


Player 4 is the easiest with respect to memory because you don't have to recall the previous scene. Player 4 is also the most pressure-filled position because he/she/they must come out with the killer instinct to end the game with something big.


### Premature is good (Emcee)

Err on the side of calling the final scene early when the players hit a major Button. It might happen in the first line because the last player comes out with something totally out of the ball park. The energy of the last person is crucial and you don't want them to have to build it back up again.
